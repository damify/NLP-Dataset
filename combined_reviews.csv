Joy Biswas,"1it was very good at playing video but after update there is no full screen option, in my tablet i have to manually turn on auto rotate then i can watch in full screen. Updates make it worse."
Pankaj Gupta,Very disgusting app
Prajwal N Poojary,"Wz, and Rd z,hvH b h,h"
Wendil Eudilla,It always deducting my gcash even though i already cancelled my subscription.so dissappointing
noah loeffler,Invincible 10/10
Nadeem Nadeem,This app an amazing experience for watching movies and series. I have really enjoyed it a lot.
Yophono,Sometimes just doesn't work. Getting stuck in infinite loading or just pausing your movie and skipping through it for no reason. Ui is also terrible.
sanjay pratap,Even though we are subscribed still so many best movies are under rent
Sam Coles,Was awesome when i first joined but just recently its got ads and a lot of buy or rent stuff instead of it being free.
Red ‚ÄúStranded Ace‚Äù Baron,I would have given it's 5 stars if not for the lack of a speed playback option.
Yashmit Sharma,Sometimes does not load
Josephite Taz,The new ads they introduced is just pathetic. Already paying for subscription and they want more money. Getting revenue from the ads isn't enough so they charge customers on top. Atleast get rid of ads on the app. It takes more data to load these ads.
Kuro Sparda,"Good but Netflix app is much better, or any video software, such as VLCmedia player the past 15 years. Its oblivious that they didnt figure the basic stuff out yet. Who are they hiring? 2 stars cause I could watch the video in HD quality most of the time. Cheers. PS.: if you hire me, you beat Netflix, gl out there Amazon!"
Tim Davis,Don't fall for the $2.99 no commercials scam
Jabir Khan,You have added most probably a useless feature of identifying actors but you cannot add a lock and playback speed. Nor a zoom option with pinching.
ansley Carvalho,Exciting movies to watch
Arsen Tovmasyan,disgusting no star
jitendra dubey,Nice app
Donald warren Moon jr,I'm so excited to see what the Eyes of the Lord is not working for me to get ahold of you
Yashwanth,"PROBLEMS TO BE NOTED PLEASE : 1) When you open any video, it doesn't go automatically in full screen mode, have to manually do it everytime. 2) You can't get the video streched end to end of screen, the zoom option just zooms the video which results in picture getting cut. I request you to please fix these as soon as possible."
Reel Michigan Bass-turds,Love it!
zeenat khan,"Bohat bekar hai ye 2 din se login karre hai hora nai, forget password b karo to b nai customer care me call karo to number change hai, dusre number pe koi call answer hi nai kara hai. Isse acha Netflix hai stupid Amazon (all amazon products stupid)"

King_Crusader_1,"I'm confused why Im required to pay for the service, and have to pay more to watch TV shows to then still watch ads"
Reginald Ferguson,I love the versatility of this app
abnair signup,"Watch movies or series in Prime if you don't have any other option. The subtitles in prime is horrible and spoils your movie experience. For example,there is quite a bit of Spanish dialogues in oceans thirteen. But the bast-urds in Amazon don't have subtitles for Spanish dialogues. Even if you give feedback to these as*hol**, they don't anything. And not just for one movie, there lot of such movies. If possible try other platforms. Amazon mfs always spoils yourmovie experience.Rat bast-urds."
Bianca Fernandes,lemme use it 1st
Sagadeven Samy,It's okay
Jack Fawthrop,The primary reason I use streaming is to avoid adverts as they make me feel sick and yet Amazon have now managed to change a subscription that I already pay for to include adverts. I'm so sick of their greed I just wanted to watch things without adverts
Rashmi Patil,Plz upload Hindi version of o Kadhal kanmani
Phoenix Wood,You pay a monthly fee and have to pay for loads in app
Peter Embrey,"Has hardly anything I want to watch. If I find one its on another subscription, so 2 payments for 1 service. Why is South Park season 2 not available, you cant just skip seasons."
Mithun Bambhania,All series and movies are good. But you have to change your media player brightness setting. It's alway very dark and difficult to see when dark scene came on screen. Same scene we can see very bright in other media player or other ott. I hope u resolve this issue soon.
Anand Kumar,"Bahut hi bekar app hai download kie hue videos chalate hi nahi Customer support usase bhi ghatiya hai, Sorry customer support hai hi nahi,mujhe ye kahana chahie ."
Michal Les,Player is garbage you have to manually zoom in on every video and it stops playing at any misclick
Carlos H. Alaniz,I hate ads.
Roy,Oh dear! Annoying advertising. App deleted.
Manjeet kumar Mahto,Very very nice
Gavin Gallegos,Great content. Frame rate drops every time I play something
Jathin Jaishur,Not streaming at FHD eventhough I have good internet speed
Nandini,Nice app
Michael Larose,For the most part prime video is nice. Now the thing that really does irritate are the commercials. Why do we pay almost 20 dollars a month for a service that decided to adopt commercials? Now I do also like the fact that you can have all your subscriptions in one place.
Kenneth Yuen,"Why do I need to paid for subscriptions if I have to watch ad that I can not skip, and further more there are two extra unskipable ad in the middle of my tv show, what the hell!!!"
VAIBHAV,"Even after subscribing the prime video, I've to pay(rent) for many movies. This is ridiculous .Netflix is far better than this"
neetesh kumar,Good

Izzy Driggers,Way too many ads. We already pay enough for prime as it is
Gopal Prajapati,Acha he
Hush Morn,Thought I was paying a premium for an ad free experience...
Andrea,I often look forward to coming home from work and watching Prime Video after a long day and that is how you know when something is good. It's more than just something to pass the time until work the following day. I really enjoy it. Also there are other benefits to experience with Amazon Prime including the Amazon Music and Amazon Reading.
Sanjay Chauhan,Bsdk panchayat season 3 release kar do
Logan Carte,Littered with ads. No fresh exposure to different or new material. All targeted Algorithm suggestions
Jodie Grimley,"You start charging for series halfway through watching. I'm considering getting rid of Prime. There are much better streaming apps that take a monthly fee and give you the whole content for that amount. You do have a half decent selection of stuff, though a lot of the other apps have the same. I started watching Walking Dead on prime, when it then decided I had to pay half way through I moved to Disney+ and watched the rest for free. Greedy buggers!"
Muni Pulivari,Super
Aditi,"I'm a foreigner in Japan using prime. So many Hollywood movies don't have English subtitles. I think prime provides English subtitles in other countries, so why not Japan? This limits the movies I can watch, so I have to think of not continuing the subscription further."
Adam Phillip,"Personally for me with the kind of entertainment i watch prime is amazing, now that the streaming catalogue has grown vastly ranging from all kinds of genres such as drama , action , thriller crime series , comedy its just as good as netflix maybe even better as it provides you with multiple different streaming services within the one app. The only negative for me is paying a full pay subscription only to be asked to pay again for services your paying for too watch in the first place #freetshir"
Dust,The fact that as much as Amazon makes and they still enforce ads is insane. After my sub runs out I will not be using again
Jos√© Mata,P√©sima
Gyanadutta Nayak,"Panchayat 3 lao pehle, fir baat karenge.."

Isaac Barnes,"I really enjoy the prime app, good stuff!"

Hazo Dickerson,"S23 refresh rate problem. Can't watch TV on this. It's the app as Netflix, Disney+, Max and Paramount all work fine all day long."
Michelle Bailey,huh
steven signaigo,The Commercials on Prime are a freakin Disgrace....why they went to Freveee Everything is PATHETIC!!
Matthew Carr,It is a great brand. I love the variety on here
Chris Mcguire,Sweet.
Joachim,It's good but the lack of resolution selection sucks. I payed for 4k and I want to watch in 4k!
PanginsDuhh,It would be better if you didn't have to pay extra to remove ads.
Dallas Krahn,It's always been good for me always found something to watch
Eric Lustbader,"Won't even open. Tried uninstall and reinstall, still won't open."

Obed Torres,Always something good to watch and easy to use.
Al Dajero,So far so good.......binging time.
Justine Ely,"Where did Watch Party go????? Was planning to use it to watch with a friend a few states away, and it's gone with no warning? Way to make the app less desirable."
Jarred Castetter,It's always average but never bad! Thanks Jeffy Bezos!!!
azucena chavez,What's up with the ads?
Jeremiah Schmucker,Wish I could uninstall
arumuga raj,Special
Gary Lane,Good
william wertz,Poor quality movies
Jeff Lockhart,I am disappointed that they are now running ads.
Shea SN,"After every episode, it only prompts to another series. So I have to go back to the main menu, find the ""continue watching"" section, and select my show."
Adalberto Frances,Great funny stuff guys keep up the good work with the easy access to the app.
Wilfredo Asencio,great movies and originals with lots ti download
Jack McKimm,Ads for a paid subscription service? I'm out.
Thavone Boosykhot,Not sure
Jessey Fitzpatrick,Cost too much and lacks options that you don't have to pay extra for
Teagan Neudorf,Showing ads on an app that I pay for is unacceptable
Nathan Bare,If you want to pay for two memberships of prime and stack. Get ready for 6 ads per 20min episode 30seconds each. If you want to get rid of maybe a third (only the prime ads ) you can pay a sweet 3$. Garbage money grab. Bezos is a bald greasy dick with a endless thurst for his endless money to feed his addiction to young boys. Enjoy further supporting him with this garbage
Catherine Larkin,"was better before changes not happy can't download old series,when could a month ago"
Cody Vanasse,I was told It was a ad free streaming service which isn't true
pieter cremers,wanna see a.movie. cant pay with visa or mastercard. come on
Janice vd Merwe,Fantastic!
OA Detailing,I really like it specially üòª
JD Creighton,"Used to be good but then after streaming killed cable they now have ads, wouldn't be surprised if it gets worse in the next few years. Content is great and interface is ok to use except if you have small children it's extra easy for them to accidentally subscribe to premium channels and movies. Should be set default for confirmation."
cath Simpson,"Easy to use, good movies, clear pics. Thanks"
B V,I have amazon prime but I still get ads.
Szabi,When I start playing something my screen just freezes unless I put my phone sideways before I tap on play. I have to restart my phone each time I forget to use the sideways method. Would like a fix. Otherwise I can't give 5*. I have a Xiaomi 12T. No other app has this problem.
Ryan Snyder,Couldn't access my account so I called for assistance and was told my account has been locked dude to me not using it and I've used it within the last year! Since when do service lock you out for nonuse because for me this is a first. And the customer service acting agitated cuz I was having a hard time understanding her even though she clearly started talking clearer after I said I was having a hard time understanding her accent
Amanda Pollard,"It's not just that the app is more frustrating to use than others, or that lately it has seemed to only get more laggy, but the introduction of ""ads unless you pay up"" + the sheer volume of ads has ruined it. At least others offer decent discounts for their ad tiers, while Amazon keeps moving content to Freevee to make sure even ad-free subscribers are inundated. No one wants or uses the ever-growing list of prime ""services"" they keep increasing prices for. We need affordable options, not this."
mayank pihu,okii
Vernon Williams,It's got me hooked on movies and I want shopping. I hate TV
I Am,"Disk_10_Error. Does not allow downloads. Error shows up every time. Have cleared cache, and have allowed data. It just does not allow downloads, which makes it pointless for long commutes."

Davide Paccagnan,Pubblicit√†
Miguel Guajardo (Zekard),"I paid a year subscription to prime, but for you, it seems that it doesn't matter, as per you keep shoving adds at the launch of the app, when I begin a video, etc... Pick one; premium or adds Edit: I guess you choose being AH, since you even ADDED even more adds to already PREMIUM account."
Team The stars,Good app

Swagatam Roy Chowdhury,Give Panchayat 3
prahlad 007,So bad app
Lucky Nguyen,"Used to love streaming on Amazon Prime, but now there's commercials everywhere! It's so annoying and lowers the bar on the user experience. Now, you have to pay an extra fee to get around the commercials. C'mon now Bezos! You're worth over 200 billion. DONT BE SO GREEDY."

Nikhil Prabha,Good

William Cliett,It used to be okay until you brought it all these commercials
Charlie Humboldt,Love it.
Anthony Cloyd,Too many ads. I don't need to pay a subscription to watch ads. I can watch all their content online for free with no subscription so that's what I'll be doing for now on. VPNs rule.
Andrew DeNegre,I shouldn't have to watch commercials being a prime member
Cami,I wish that we could read reviews that are written by actual critics that have already seen the movie

Velvet Barnes-Grimshaw,"This app is ridiculous. Every time I try to watch something, it's either spinning (loading) or it tells me the video is unavailable. I'm canceling my subscription today. I'm not gonna keep paying for an app that barely works. Smh. Update: As of today, after canceling the app last year and deciding to come back, this app is still an absolute nightmare to cast on. I'm as usual looking at ""Sorry, this video is not available."""
Deidre Fleet,"I pay for a subscription, but I still can't watch my favorite shows on anything besides my phone. Most of the shows don't work on my firestick because of ""date or rights restrictions"" but then work on my phone.

I have deleted and re-installed the app on 2 of my tvs, but I just get a blank screen when i open the app. Furthermore, what's the point of ad free if im still required to watch ads for the apps new shows."
Sulandia Kidd,Good
Candi Steward,The app has not streamed in over a week.
stick animator,Ues
Eve Davis,Terrible
Dot Jones,I've tried to stream/cast several shows and there's always an issue. This further tells me this app is seriously flawed. There's nothing to change my mind about keeping this.

Evelyn Horton,Pleasant. Love the games

Shameka Grayson,"This app is prohibiting my ability to cast to my in home TV. Every time I use it the app crashes. I'm paying for an app that does not work well. My family just wants to enjoy some of Tyler Perry's shows. Developers, can you fix the casting glitch?"
Maria Angel,"I am In my 7 day trial period. I only switched because we cut the cord. But this app is very slow, it just buffer's. Also I never knew that the shows that are on regular BET don't update on the BET +. For what you pay i can't say it's worth it. Update- The up-to-date BET shows are actually on Philo. I will not be paying for BET+ plus again, for $25 a month I can see all my BET shows and so many much more! I'll never come back. üòè"

Tavi Ren√°e,"Be advised if you have Fire TV or Fire Stick, the more affordable option doesn't work. You have to get the $9.99 subscription. I subscribed to the $5.99 version via the Playstore and nothing would load on my TV. Then I signed up directly through Amazon and only the $9.99/Mo subscription was an option and the app finally worked on my Fire TV. It's not obvious that you are limited to one option when purchasing through the Playstore."
Petula Tomer,Awesome
lorethia Burch,Definitely Promises. Having a ability for this pleases me delightfully. Growing one self. Ernise Ann Lee.
Victoria Hall,"Getting Alot of ""Sorry, this video is not found or no longer available due to date or rights restrictions""... I'm paying for a service I can't fully use. Logged in on my tv."

Ready to cancel altogether!"
Robb Snobbs,Good morning üåÑ
Lex Aiken,Great üëçüèø
Lil Mouse,The app buffers a lot. I also have to pay bet+ twice a month and I don't understand y I should be paying bet+ once a month 10.99 but I'm paying that twice a month. And now it wants me to pay for the second time this month in the app that I subscribed to it from which would be Google play but I can't find bet+ in my subscriptions now think imma delete the app!!!

Teresa Lyann Williams (MISSISSIPPI Girl70),I really enjoy watching bet all my favorite shows and all the queens men is my favorite üòç
Ana G,"I am beyond frustrated and mad. This app is the only app I have problems with. And they make it hard to cancel subscription. I have a Samsung TV. Plus, they don't have a customer service representative that you can talk to."
Jahlilah Johnson,"I just canceled my subscription because I don't understand why BET wouldn't have the new episodes of their own shows updated on their app. The app doesn't have the latest seasons on any of my favorite shows. They haven't uploaded the latest episode of Sistas, All the Queens men, or Ruthless. It's very disappointing. Not to mention the app glitches a lot too."
LaShonda Bryant,Very disappointed. I got this thinking I could catch up on all of my favorite shows on BET. But I guess on some shows it only goes back to 2022 and forget seeing 2023-present not going to happen. Who would of thought that?
Jalee Winfrey,"This app sucks, what's the point if nothing is getting updated"
Deborah Dillard,Not working on my phone. Can't get any service.

Dylan Wagner,Honestly really bad
Darlene Rowley,I do not understand why it not update the season why it on season 1.
Ivette,Horribleness
Brittany Strange,"This app doesn't work properly. It doesn't work on samsung tv anymore either. I used to be able to cast episodes to my Chromecast even though the time was off it at least did that. Last week I was able to watch on samsung TV and now the app won't even load. I've Uninstalled, reinstalled troubleshot to the best of my ability...this app is garbage and I wish I could get a refund on my subscription."
A Google user,BET SUCKS...AD BREAKS ALL THE TIME... GET OFF MY PHONES.
07imhungry,"Need to throw in the trash and hire new developers! How in the world you want folks to sign up but don't have access to what they have taken money out for. Clearly there is an issue with all the reviews having the same issue. All the steps they tell you to do, does not work. The new owners are clearly slacking because this issue should have been resolved and I'm about to cancel my subscription, I guess I will cancel my subscription and catch whatever comes on TV and be satisfied."
Leslie Washington,I just tried to subscribe and y'all wouldn't let me in and I had everything correct email my password and everything y'all still didn't let me subscribe is something wrong with your damn app
Judith Lopez,Judithlopez

Shonda Mitchell,Love it!!!!!!
V. Smith,"Just received a free trial for 7 days. Glad I am not paying to use the app because it SUCKS. It keeps saying SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NOT AVAILABLE, which means I have been unable to watch anything. If I could rate this app a 0 I would. FIX THE PROBLEM. This is an app problem because other customers are saying the say thing. If not fixed by the time the trial is over I will not purchase a subscription. ü§îüò°"
Kimberly reed,I was not able to cast this bet app from my phone to my TV I would like for my money to be refund is one day after the trial I have been trying to get this corrected and why should I have to pay for the whole month when I cannot watch it now it's telling me I won't be charged after the initial period why not a full refund when I cannot watch it this is one day after the trial period
Christy Scott,Love it ! very good app to have
Reginald Metellus,The Statue of Liberty

Marina Crawford,I love it
Latisha Rainey,I have canceled bet plus several times and changed my card number because it kept charging me for several different things and for some reason it's still charging my new card after it wouldn't let me watch it after it took my money and wants me to keep paying for it. Disappointed.
Jacqueline Jones,"5 STAR, Nothing Else To Say"

Latesha Pleas,Good
Nyidah Parker,"Honestly we should all just delete the app. They are aware of these on-going issues and refuse to do anything . I've updated,deleted and re-downloaded the app, I have the premium and i still can not play it on my smart tv. I tried once again but that's it after march 12th"
Bridgette Thomas,"The app will not play when I try to cast to my TV. It happens from time to time, but today, it will not cast at all. It'll play on my phone, not not my TV. I fo not have this issue with any other app. Please resolve. Thank you."
kwanafaye Carrethers,"Why am I paying to watch old episodes of the oval and sisters as well as all the queens men This where they all air at ,not right"

Jacqueline Woodum,5 I got you five star
Jesse Edwards,Don't no can't never get my phone to download it
Winston Christian,AWESOME
Nikki Hill,Too many ads for a paid subscription and it crashes and/or gives error mesages too often. Nobody has ever opened a app to see ads. If anything we use apps to avoid ads/commercials. 5-7 ads before your show starts is waaay too many. Very disappointed.
Cedric Bennett,The app doesn't work it just went black
Erika Lindsey,Free Trial
Aaliyah Simpson,"This is the worst subscription ever! Not because of the movies and show selections but because it NEVER allows me to watch it on my Firestick through my Samsung TV. I always receive an error message saying 'Sorry this video is not available.' Reaching out to tech support is worst than ever, they're only email-based and that can take days for a response just for them to ask for information you already provided during the initial complaint. It's a waste of money."
Kim Burgin,Paid 10 dollars for no commercials after paying 30 mins into watching a show the screen went black go out go back n screen still black can't watch anything for my money I just rather pay another app instead of waste n my money had the app a yr a go but it would open after I paid So dissatisfied
Diane Reaves,"I canceled BET plus 2/4/24 because it stopped letting me play it on my Roku device for the essential price. I would have to pay the higher price, but it still came on my IPad. They turned it off. I even got a confirmation email stating so. This month they took out another payment from my account, and it's back on. I emailed BET support and they are telling me they can't cancel it until I give them this GPA number from the Google Play account that supposedly are emailed monthly. I can't find IT."
Joseph crawford,Clear Precise Accurate
Cathy Royale,App has some serious issues plz delete this request for free trail
Karen Stewart,"I canceled my subscription because I had 5 random names on my account, and I didn't have a way to log them out. That's a security issue on the BET+ part. Besides that, it takes too long to add new episodes. The main reason for canceling the subscription was the 5 different profiles on my screen."
Steven Johnson,This app needs more new movies and up to date shows
Clarise Carrington,Downloaded the App and it takes payment for a restricted app. This is not right I Love the shows I am very disappointed in Bet.

This is very disappointing BET+ ok apparently you didn't read my post I have reinstalled this app 3xs and still the samething and why am I clearing a cache for the TV? Maybe I didn't make myself clear im speaking of the TV app it's freezing up I literally have to turn my TV off to get my TV to work or move off of your app no other app is doing this but BET+ üëéüèæ TO YOUR RESPONSE
Irene Mccoy,I STILL LIKE BET & I ALSO LOVE MRS.JOHNSON THE BACKBONE IF BET BUT I DO AGREE THAT SOME PROGRAMS DON'T REALLY EXEMPLIFY THE EXTRAORDINARY FEARFULLY & WONDERFULLY MADE PEOPLE WE ARE KINGS & QUEENS..WE KNOW OUR HISTORY..THE GOOD BAD & THE UGLY..SEE WE'RE GRIOTS.....TREATIES WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE BROKEN JUST LIKE PROMISES..

Lawrence Pierce,"Have,not,tried,it,yet?"
Nine Hamilton,I always read reviews and I'm so thankful I do. I was going to get this app so glad I didn't. Thanks to everyone that took time out to warn the next innocent buyer not to waist your time and money. People pay attention to the reviews they are there for a reason. Buyer BEWARE!
Rickee Campbell,Duty and the other day that you can be est for the most important de of your life in 2
R Husband,Do any body got an account with bet I can used on my TV cause the apps I got are boring and I'm tired of watching all the movies on the app SUMBODY PLEASE HELP ME
Helen Hines,"I love The movies and series on this app, but it barely works. Why is it that anything connected to black entertainment you think we shouldn't have quality? I want quality app for BET+. It is so frustrating when you're watching a good movie. And I paid by the year."
Netta,Do not download this app you cannot stream it from any of your smart TVs only from your mobile devices.
Karyn Hale,It keep on spinning

John Mulkey,Thanksgiving ü¶ÉüçΩÔ∏è
N'kenza Whitlow,The app works fine with the exception of not being able to remove shows in the continue to watch section. There is no edit button to remove shows my mom no longer wants to watch so she has all these shows listed. How can this be fixed?
Lakisha Coates,"I had to unsubscribe. Besides the ads that were NOT supposed to pop up, I couldn't get the new episodes. I tried refreshing the app, reinstalling the app,.... Didn't help at all."
D. Ann Hodo,hove this app all the Q Men is my favorite üòÄ
Jacob Hammond,"This new update sucks. Y'all are making millions of dollars and you can't fix this?! It's glitchy, had to restart the app. Also when I go to my Watchlist of everything I saved... Gone. The check mark will be there, but in the watchlist there is nothing. Wth?!"
JFT,I don't want people having my info. Do better Google!
keke c,How are you not allowing me to make a payment and get my subscription back?But you're trying to get me to do a bundle deal when I don't need it
Joan Kelly,Not good
Charlie Honey,"One Of The Best Streaming service that there is, but last few months has been lots of error messages & problems"
HHZ202 Conle.b,terrible
Brian Cropton,Great value
Mark R,Never able to play downloaded content
Atomic Apologetics,"I ended my subscription due to the lousy new shows. Not to mention the political messaging that they keep shoving down our throats. We get it, you're woke. Now make some good content that stays true to the genre. When you bought LucasFilm, I genuinely had hope. But after The Last Jedi, and the character assassination of Luke Skywalker, I knew you had no intention in keeping Lucas' vision. You focus only on women as flawless heroes while making men irrelevant and hapless. I hope you crash."
Kimberly,Freeze and close on android and xbox
Saskia Phillip,"worst app ever. no matter how strong your wifi is, it buffers every single time. which is just a pain"
Tyler Hogan,"The cost of this is not worth it, it used to be a reasonable price, now is ridiculous"
Liz,"Won't be signing up for another year with Disney Plus as every single time I turn my TV off it logs me out and makes me sign up again by entering my email and password. Why not link from the app? I'm not even bothering with it anymore, so many other apps to choose from that don't do this!!"
Dallas Burnett,Best streaming platform out there.
Erin,"Probably the most reliable app! It has continuity issues, though."
Eduardo Rond√≥n,I have never known a more useful beautiful intelligent app in my history of living.. we shall stand United in supporting Disney Plus because without our love and sanctity how can we say we support the Canadian dream when we can't even support the dreams of our children.
Victor Rosas,great shows to watch!
Tekarra Pywell,I love this app only ever had an issue once I called they fixed it right away for me and the lady named Ann was extremely helpful and gave me excellent customer service. I am a very happy customer.
Venecia,"Every since I installed the new upgrade, my app has been glitching. I can't get through to the app. Customer service doesn't help either."
Biggie Cheese,"The best thing about this app is having to be connected to the internet to watch the stuff you have downloaded for when you don't have an internet connection. Also, it really loves to log you out randomly and delete your downloads. Thankfully, I didn't pay for a full year in advance."
jonathan finsen,amazing!
Will Brennan,this app gets me paranoid because it can it can freeze your whole life what is wrong with technology nowadays like The Matrix
Dan Joseph,woke

Marla Hamby,Awsome
Arthur Rangel,"App no longer works on my Huawei p20, simply won't update."
Phantise Johnson,This is the best app
Mia Randazzo,Honestly disney plus all over is making me so mad. The merge with hulu is so annoying. The fact there's so little customization to the kids profiles. My sons all have to have adult accounts instead of kids to access things like finding Nemo or moana. What's the point in having kids accounts if we can't pick what our kids can watch? Now everytime they open disney they see American Horror Story and get scared. Disney needs to get it together for the prices we're paying. I'm almost ready to cancel
Lilly Nicholson,Awful app. I try and try to cancel my account and keep getting charged.
TecH NumbeR971,Horrible humans run this company. Help your children mental health and don't put them in front of this garbage so gross and Disturbing !!! üôè

Chip Kempston,Signed back up to watch a couple things. Big mistake. Amount and length of ads make everything unwatchable. Canceling again.
Harry Quigley,Very good Disney thank
Eden Endicott,Just so fun
Harry Wong,"You app on playstation always crashes when streaming new content Still crashing when watching new stuff so bad, patch it please"
Laurin Brunet,Love it
James Pierson,You suck stop trying to be the next cable company that's what it is if you pay the cheaper fee for the ads it reminds me of cable TV before streaming was a thing that's why they partner with Hulu and ESPN they're trying to make streaming into the new cable I get one maybe two ads before the show starts on max and Disney puts several ads throughout the entire show?!! No wonder it went from 7 dollars no ads to 15 dollars and vise versa this is a kids network parents pay for it
Denise Williams,too much storage required
efon wang,not enough content for the price
Edward Conteras,My family enjoys Disney very much
Mark Seven Da Issue,very glitchy
Ben Blanchard,it just wont download
Oli B,very nice application
Jessica Morris,"The Disney+ app keeps indicating an update is needed to proceed with using the app; however, on my TV, it will not allow us to select Update, and on my phone, when I select Update, it takes me to the App store where there is no option to update the app. The only options are to Open or Uninstall. When I select Open, it takes me back to the screen that indicates an update is needed. Uninstall is starting to look appealing, as well as canceling my subscription, if this doesn't get rectified soon."
Ryan Guildford,Doesn't work after latest update
A Google user,I can downlod my movies
Cameron Morris,I have loved this app for a long time. For some reason lately it will not let me stream anything star wars. It has an error every single time. I can watch absolutely anything else just not star wars. It is very irritating. Please fix.
Mel Smith,very easy to use.
Trellis Lane,fireee
Elizabeth Murray,Haven't used it can't review

Greg Lemon,"I am re-watching the Infiniti saga, the Avengers movies all hold up very very well. enjoy them all as much or more than the first time around."
Oliver Morgan,Great service just don't think it should hike up in price but regardless love the show's.
Nuno Pinto,"Every movie now ""features"" stupid disclaimers how the thoughts described withing are ""incorrect"" and how disney being such good people let us still watch it after reading such nonsense. Every single new movie now forcibly ""features"" black people, gay people, multitude of genres in such a way that everything is becoming pathetic and manipulated. Get a grip, most people don't care about all this BS, we just want content as it's meant to be, unfiltered, unbiased. You're a shadow of your past."
Andrew Otte,"Disney has great content, especially with older shows. Lost, x=files, it's always sunny, my name is earl, etc. I will not run out of content. However, the APP itself is VERY BAD - paramount plus level of bad. 5 stars for content, 1 star for the atrocious app."
Viorel Itior,Ok
David Szonda,"Previously I have given 5 stars, that is now changing. I was trying to sign into my account and the requested for me to create a new password. I 've tried several different ones combining at least 6 letters, at least 2 numbers and 2 special characters. It just WOULD NOT accept anything. So now I can't log into my account. I have tried their customer service which then just terminated just before I've got any meaningful answers.. By the way I love the conent."
T Gomes,Very annoying. If you download anything you can't stream it to the TV. Annoying when your kids watch the same show over and over and both options are handy.
Hugo Ceruti,j'ai plusieurs applications de visionnage/ streaming et c'est bien la seule qui est incapable de g√©rer un faible r√©seau. quand les autres appli ont un temp de chargement elles relance le programme sur une longue dur√©e. Disney + relance pour un nouveau temp de chargement 10s apr√®s..
D G,MiO cannot play. it's a shame
Rahul Chintalapudi,this is awesome üòé
ARLO :3,"Great app, has an amazing range of movies and series. 100% recommended getting this app if you don't have it x"
Katie Rideout,apps fine but there's no way to change your subscription level when you subscribe through Google play. it automatically signs you up for the highest tier.
Team The stars,This app is amazing
Benji Preston,"Reliable and good selection, but miss the Group Watch ability."
Evelyn M Harris,I love Disney plus it's my only streaming app
Mollie,Amazing love the movies on the really recommended
Nicola Downey,the simsons is great
Kevin Gillard,Constantly just shuts down in the middle of a show. Now I can't rewatch an episode I want. I select it and it snaps me to the latest episode. I'm so done with this BS. I absolutely hate this app. DO BETTER
Fridayand Gurls TheManitobaKrew,"I'm changing my review today. Horrible experience today. Can't log into my account to watch or download shows. After inputting password they try to send a six digit one time code to my email which is not coming through. After talking to someone at help center on phone I find out there is a technical problem happening with them sending out the codes. Wondering if it has to do with new update came out yesterday, April 15, which I had to use to continue using the app for shows...not happy at all"
Samuel Harrison,"Firstly, let me start off by saying the content Disney+ offers is superb! It is my favourite app for watching all my favourite programmes such as Star Wars, Marvel and Disney/Pixar. However, the main problem I have with the app, is the downloads. Even though I download movies and series to my phone storage, I regularly encounter issues trying to watch the content offline. This either requires me to restart the app/phone, or to delete the content and redownload it at a later date."
Maria Pruett,Who do I contact about my bundle not working right?
Kristin Olivia,Ugly update. Keeps CRASHING. Worked perfectly fine before.
Mason Kearney,it's so laggy it's so bad
William Rhodes,Loving it
Brent Miller,I do enjoy some of the content. I really HATE having to type in a 4-diget code every time I open this app.
Josiah Auguste,This was awful because I had the yearly subscription and then 1 day later the subscription ended. I lost all of my money.
p funk,I need season 2 NOW!
Simone Clough,Hu 88 vv g x vverccvv cv
Alyssa Lewis,"Update It does work much better now. But I still often have issued if I download a show and try to watch it offline, there's a 50/50 shot it won't work Unable to connect. It's great when it works but everytime I open it, especially on my tablet, it is unable to play. Lousy"
Jayden Franko,bussin
Kat Crawford,Easy to use. Works better than it used to. Huge improvement.
Shane Enniss,"since last update, which is a forced one, the picture brightness and colour change every few seconds. reminds me of the macrovision protection effect on old vhs system. using the app on 2018 sony tv. strangely it does'nt happen on all content. extremely annoying."
Vert axli,blech
Ansen AK,Pathetic content.
rcatina,"After last app update on April 15 the app is no longer compatible with my Xiaomi Mi Box Android TV device, despite being advertised as compatible on the Disney website. Please fix this, thank you."
Dadogg Did,wow that's awesome how many people can play together
Kenny Potts,Check out disney's pedro pascal new website pascal subsluts.
saffy baby,What is the yellow exclamtion mark? Also idk what happened with the last couple updates. Now next episodes don't start until the ALL the credits have completely run and the episode or show ends. You have a ton of language credits. Plus now you can't select anything to play while something is playing unless you exit the app or skip to the end of the credits and the program ends. This never use to be an issue so please fix it. Also it is no longer registering watched episodes so i have to guess.
Julie Warden,I have hard time watching. it keeps glitching
King Cannibus (King Cannibis),always logging off and giving error codes only app that consistently doesn't work
Zinhan Win,"Is one of the slowest, cumbersome and buggiest apps on my TV"
Nina Fedorek,"On bluey the sign, the ending made my cry happy tears"
Amanda Azzali,We love it! It works very well. Wish we could download on our laptop
Vanessa Calvente,i agree that disney super slow.
Aimee Bonato,Since the new update the app glitches every single time. Makes it hard to continue the subscription especially when the app is almost unusable.
P SzPz,"Casting to TV is a nightmare. Skip recap or skip intro never shows up, time bar is never accurate, when you stop casting the notification player is still there unless you force an stop.... Is the casting not tested at all?"
Kelvin Guzm√°n lantigua,Ithis does not work
Imran Usman,Promoters of children genocide
Pare-Ana Clayton,"Hello Team, Thank you for supplying some terrific movies and TV series. I like that I can watch the Marvel programs in order and many times over. I give this app a 4.5 rating as I'm always having to wait so long just to download an episode of a series, and most of the time, it doesn't even start to download. Surely, there must be a way to fix this problem. Regards PB."
Scott Mifsud,"It is a really good app, it has a lot of good movies on it but I have I complaint. Why are NONE of the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man movies on here that is pretty much why I got it. And it also takes ages to load sometimes and they're always deleting things on it like idk why any Spider-Man fans would get this app. *I know that the app used to have some Spider-Man movies and Ghost Rider on it because I remember watching them all on it*"
Claire B.,A classic. Love it!
wells hutchins,"Too many commercials, and crummy ones at that. Not worth the subscription."

Paul Sturgeon,Disney is nothing like it used to be. I think it's about time to dump them.
Claudia Torres,love it
Gabriela Goncalves,"It has a lot of room for improvement. I. Here because I'm a fan but this app can be frustrating sometimes. From not having the option to go to the next episode from the phone app (on the desktop it doest), to being slow to load, not quickly switching to a new show as a press play ( I had to disconnect and cast again to be able to change show half way through). I have to say that Netflix is so smooth by comparison. Disney is a big company. Do better!"
Kyle Blanchard,Need to update their selection of shows/ movies. Pretty much have watched everything on Disney. Probably going to cancel my subscription soon
issa koroma,Great app awesomeüëç

Tony Fudge,so you can't even sort out an up date.
Tim Norlock,Won't email me a 6 digit code. Completely useless if I can't use it. Will adjust rating as soon as I can access the app again! And yes my email is typed out properly and yes I checked my spam!

Benny Aceves,there's so many movies in Disney I just have to watch them all
Lewis Henry,"I would like to be able to delete items in my continue watching section, rather than having to go in to each one and manually finishing it. Also need the option to view only movies or series. Would be 5 star if you fixed these."

Molly Mckenna,updated re\lly fast
Eric Nsoah Feudjio,X-man 97 carries
Anisanthus,"App advertises downloadable content to watch without Internet, yet won't boot up without an Internet connection, continuing to give Error 42 (connection issues)."
Glenn Cambell,Far to many updates how DARE you force an update HOW DARE YOU thieves also trying to sneak though an almost 40% price increase need to have a zero star option
Steven R.,excellent storytelling and superb action.
DevvyDevDev08,Great
Ezra Heiderscheidt,good price for lots of stuff
Rosanna Cia,Disappointed that as of 19th April you will be charging 17.99 a month. WHAT for?? Are you gonna give anything extra with this price increase. So greedy!!
Dean Kucinskas,it won't send confirmation code to my email
Masheika Atkins,Disney plus still has a bug it won't let me update my payment or anything
Brendan Duggan,it's sooooo awful I'd rate it 0 stars if I could . The worst thing is I can't update it this is the worst app and no one can actually deny it if you buy this it'll saysorryyou have to get a stupid update that won't work
Erinique Mackey,Nice cool yea
Bruno Amaral,Should have more content.
Sigurbj√∂rn Karlsson,it is great
MarijuanaMan,Just like Shitlu now. Doesn't remember where you leave off and randomly plays whatever episode you've already watched before. Pathetic. Just another greedy lazy piece of trash corporation. Such a piss poor app. Doesn't work correctly on anything.
Andy Wilson,"Disney+ is great for my daughter, there is no need for shelves of DVDs anymore and also keeps me entertained with series like The Mandalorian and Shogun"
Pedro M.,Boycotting Disney+ for terminating its Group Watch feature. Uninstalled
Michael Parker,Getting to expensive
Paige Jacobs,So good u get the latest films ill recommend it to u
Mike Wilson,terrible stuttering playback even with 500mbps fibre connection
Bruno Maio,poo poo
UserKevinFlynn,"would be a 5 star, but no matter what device I stream on or how good the internet is it always stops mid stream to buffer numerous times."
john julian,Their promotion with UBER one is false advertising. You never receive the code for the free disney+.
Li,stop requiring updates
Michael mckinnon,"poor app, sinking is terrible, poor selection.waste of money"
Alexis,The app won't even open. There's a Play store notification that there were bug fixes on 4/15/24. It is midday on 4/16/24 and the app has refused to open all morning. At least 6 tries. What garbage is this?
Diana Boria,love it
Anuk Jayamuni,nah
Huma369 86790213,you can watch marvle star wars and others
Hands Screen,Really.. a logo on the visuals when watching series. Do you know how disturbing it is? Come oon. You know better that I pay for your service and do not want ads to the any area of the video. Booboo.
JRM Safety,notice!!!!!!
Yemisi Oye,I love disney + i like watching the old disney films .
Tatiana Ioana,i don t. and they don t answer to silviu or cristina good bye.
Srdjan Opruc,"This new version is bad. It doesn't work anymore on android tv stick (DQ03 model - Android 10) previous one worked normal. First I couldn't use disney+ on lg smart tv because it was webos 2.0 , after that I bought android tv stick, now it also doesn't work . You are tooo complicated. Maybe next version wouldn't work on any type of tv, you are going in that direction."
Marcus Barber,"Error code 39 when trying to watch a download. I keep having issues when trying to watch downloads, and have to delete and redownload, which is not practical when on the move."
Shawna Porter,"I pay for Disney + it says it needed a update, would not update, now saying it's not compatible when I have a higher version then needed."
Christina O Connor,Oof
Sophie,I absolutely love the content in this app although there is constant issues with the shows loading and reloading and just not working the app constantly shuts itself off and just genuinely doesn't work the best. Will continue to use as I like the shows on it but wouldnt personally recommend to anyone.
Jasmin Je≈ækov√°,My favourite streaming app. A lot of TV shows and movies to choose from. I did not have any problems so far.
Maya Horincar,Is excellent for any kid last four adults too I recommend
Mark O'Rafferty,It works and I've never had a problem with it
Shane Hadfield,"Everything from the web and the TV app is available, works perfectly on my phone."
Mason King,M‚Å∑NM.
Alison Mason,Technically it's great!I would use it every time when I want to watch the owl house or frozen or even bunk'd!!!
EMD Saggart Co.Dublin.,"Its a good app, works well on my note 8 and the tv, but a lot of the time it comes up with fault 41 or can't pick a personal account access. You have to log out and log back in again and that is on the phone & the tv, can be annoying, it happens regularly about 50%+ of the time...04/24 since last review it has gotten a lot better...worth the 4 stars now"
Kyle Smart,Love it
Reginald Metellus,The Statue of Liberty
Eduardo Dutra,Muito bom
Nura Omar,Disney is the best thing ever 5 stars
Scott Smith,really really good app
Rosa Rivera,Disney+it's one of our most used apps my kids used every time... We have thefamily plan and I don't know what's wrong with it right now with the app or what but from our TV is always log in us out and when I'm logging in it told us that the password incorrect so I have to go and reset the password and do it all again every morning because every day it just log us out and it says that my password is incorrect but it's not true I have to reset it every day
MicarSolaris,"The app no longer remembers what I've watched, and I can't load the next episode without closing the opening it."
L Krause,Cannot get app to open.
Elizabeth Walsh,"It was great until the merge with Hulu. Now it takes forever and a day to open. When I want to stop after an episode, the next one usually starts by the time the app loads for me to stop it."
Home,"First time having an issue tonight on Android tv, but doesn't seem like an isolated incident given other reviews. Literally paying for an unnecessary subscription if the app is this unreliable and kicks you out of your shows - but they have no problem taking your money!"
Chaniqua Always,"It WAS a pretty good app to have until they decided to merge it with Hulu. Since then I have to ""search"" for Disney content while as before it was all in one place. I don't care to to the 2 in one. I open Disney and see Freaknik on as a suggestion!! Let Disney be Disney and Hulu be Hulu. In addition to that, my subscription has increased 50%. I'll just have to go back to Xfinity at the point."
Maysha Lauren,child murderer supporter
William Miller,"Can download episodes for offline viewing. Android notifications confirm the episodes have been downloaded and there is a ""tick"". But when I click on downloads button there is a message ""You have no downloads"". No movies for my young one to watch on a four hour flight.... This glitch must be fixed."
Jake and Holly Anttilla,Amzing

Juan Padilla,Best Streaming Service Ever.
Monsta Fruitbat,Disney has made me upgrade. canceling!
maisie dockerty,Amazing
T. S. (Tim),It's a wonderful app to watch movies with family or girlfriend reccomend it anyone.
Mitchell Clark,Crashes almost every time I start playing something.
Poupak Irandoust,highly recommended a app without any ads
Chantelle Shaw,"Only got the extra star because I enjoy the content. The app itself is glitchy, regularly drops out and then when you reconnect it and try to resume the episode starts from the beginning instead of where you left off... on my Tab A it also regularly freezes needing restarts. Also, unlike other apps it doesn't have the feature to pause playing after a certain amount of episodes to see if you're still watching which can result in this being a time suck. Not my preferred app at all."
Izzy Hills,Sick
Michael Bryan,Is good
Leniseh Rawle,an amazing app my family love it.
Allan Bottles,"great content, easy to navigate, user friendly."
Patrick Savard,poor service.
Chris Lynas,"Interrupted me to ask for a rating. I will rate if I want to, so if you put this dialog on to of what I'm doing nag you get 1 star. Also interrupted to force an update. Not cool"
Niklas Kantimm,"Disney+ on Android smartphones is completely useless, because it does NOT support HDR10 and Dolby Vision. If they update Disney+ so that it supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision on Android for smartphones, then five stars are possible, otherwise this app is comparable to a scam. The display on all premium Android smartphones does easily compete with or surpass the quality of the best Tv's and iPhones available. Despite that, iOS gets HDR10 and Dolby Vision while Android does not. Why is that?"
David Michaelides,"expensive, especially since all I use it for is watching old Simpsons and family guy episodes but it runs fine on my tv"
Merry Romaine,quality assurance
Ariana Troxel,i love disney!
Eric McKloski,"Well, my experience has been I actually opened a Disney+ account to watch the Mandalorian just because Grogu AKA Baby Yoda really pulled me back into the Star Wars Universe.."
Letesha Mitchell,No need for update
Colton Serena,"The app use to be good but it has plummeted to bs, especially since yall decide to put stupid hulu together with Disney. This should have never happened, maybe if yall made better movies you wouldn't have to deal with this."
Carnation Leonard,"It's a great app for the kids to watch movies and programs, and I love watching the movies and programs üíì"
Jamie Jansen,I can't log out of the app to log back in with my information. It's stuck on my ex's account with no way to do anything but use his profile or create a new one?
David Maiden,"the app crashes a lot, freezes and won't load movies or shows."
Mark Eerkes,Absolutely the worst streaming app ever! Lags constantly. This last update seems to have made it even worse!
Jess M,It's good üëç
Michael Cassell,I'm a white straight male was told by many of the representatives it's not for me.
Jason Foust,"No way to skip to the next episode, changing what you are watching doesn't work, no way to select an episode from the show you are watching. How is the UI this bad?"
James Fonda,Its been almost 5 years and the app still cant show the full watchlist. How is this supposed to replace Hulu which has worked fantastically for a decaded
Sandra,"Like it's competitors, the content is very, very dated with few movies from 2020. There is no foreign content, except for the excessive ads."
Daniel Dabini,Why do we need another update scummy tactics Disney
Mike Shive,download speeds are awful
Jon,"Very mediocre. Terrible recommendations, they keep pushing things I have zero interest in, and no customization of the home screen so I'm stuck with their garbage. Then, they keep forcing updates. Annoying. Very annoying.. Let me watch star wars in piece! And may the force be with you (unless you're Disney)"
Shae Lazare,"its good but i wish disney would put surten shows/movies in different places. for emample, i watch the fosters on this app in canaas but when i went to Amercia, the show left the app until i came back to canada.i couldnt even watch my downloads of it because the show wasnt there. atleast if you cant add the show entirely in different places, atleast et the app work to let people watch there downloads, thanks. but besides that this app is very good"
Amy Canseco,issues with it stopping suddenly
Isabel Hernandez,it's such a good app and so many movies and TV shows.
Jessie Ray,"Don't know why I keep bothering with these apps, DVD and VCR players never gave me problems. Streaming apps are just making life more complicated and expensive. The app keeps freezing, long loading time, replays movies and episodes when it reaches the end or is paused, does not save your recent episode, movies stay on ""continue watching"" even when finished, recently error messages have started popping up. Happening on all my devices, nothing wrong on my end."
Nicole DeSpain,"i tried don't know what is wrong it won't open on my phone, tablet, nothing. just keeps saying app isn't responding or just closes out. pity to pay for a subscription when the app doesn't work properly."
Pravin Sookeea,Mo I Mo I 6c66Yc ek the wgirl
Brian Fedoretz,Update made it stop working.
Simba,"Login on tv app is a nightmare. Beset with all manner of streaming issues, be it live or downloaded. Comfortably the worst mainstream streaming app"
Isabella Workman,"Kids profile is for 2 year olds content no matter how change age groups and cant watch all clasic disney movies , regular profike just because i try save money and buy bundle my kid can accidently click on gross traumatizing bad influence stuff... no happy medium that i have found so far and i try my best give a fair go before complaining but then tried provide feedback on account becaise i know app developers look at it and it errors out tries connect with live person 20 people queue ü§£"

"Athma J. Birju, Esq.",Great app! Would love if there was an option to play episodes of shows like The Simpsons on random where you can pick the number of seasons and episodes you want to watch and then have them play at random or in order.

Minh Phan,wow this is the best thing ive seen in my entire 99 years of life
Jam O,"The context is realy good, however it is way overpriced to exploit people who have no other way of legally streaming there favorite shows and films. Also I believe that the limit for number of devices the subscription is limited for is to low."
Anna Glosa,I love
Liam O sullivan,grate app really enjoy watching movies and shows on it
Madison Holbrook,awesome
Danna Mart√≠nez Vera,Perfect
Aricka Richey,It has everything I like
Ignacio Martinez,"Content is great, but the app is really bad. Things you can't do: skip intro, skip to the next episode. Hard things to do: go to a specific episode (you have to search series and select, and even so, most times it plays what ever it wants). I thought it would improve over time, but several years later it is still the same."
Cameron Carlson,Download won't work
Sedrick Vinson,I love it

BILLY hill,"Need to be able to remove Content from Continue to watch,"
Michael Mccarron,Very good
Daniel lush,Childish and too woke. The main perks is them owning 20th century fox for a few good shows and marvel. You are better off buying outright what you really want or rent here and there versus a monthly cost. Considering they ruined so many franchises I'm done. Paramount plus is so much better.
Tony Thomas,HBO max has a better app. After a certain amount of time my password refuses to work. Good luck trying to get an email code. It won't ever send (not in spam folder) then the website just comes to a halt and refuses to load. Saying something went wrong. What went wrong was ever giving money for this garbage subscription.
marilyn hanscom,awesome
Linde Parke,there's nothing that I can say wrong The app is good sure it's a little pricey but it's worth every dollar

Jamie Ramsay,"So disappointed Disney, I purchased Disney plus app as an avid Marvel fan!. Selected the Marvel section, to find, you're so called complete timeline, you're MCU timeline!. Eh....Disney!, where is Spiderman Homecoming, Far from home and No way home!!. Every other Avenger but No Spiderman!. Please rectify this as your charging with ever changing increases for a complete Marvel package within the app, when clearly your NOT!!!!!."
Thomas,Give me a chance to catch up on some movies I've missed out on!
Wendy Winfield,Impossible to get onto the app.
Jayla Mangrum,it is a great app were else would you find all the Disney movie s
Cinthya 2024,"Quando mudo o idioma na configura√ß√£o n√£o funcionou, o perfil em portugu√™s e o filme em ingl√™s, sem a op√ß√£o de legenda, muito ruim, precisam colocar a altera√ß√£o de idiomas e legendas no v√≠deo igual a Netflix."

Shaye Fugitt,disney is the best
Alayna Young,I rate it 4 stars bc bluey I LOVE BLUEY but some episodes are censored or cut out entirely AND I DONT LIKE THAT!!
Christian Martinez-Carranza,"Can't switch between titles while casting. Need to end casting to select a new title. Never starts video from where I left off. Always restarts the video. Content is good, app is garbage."
Danielle,"I don't understand why this app doesn't include a feature where you can remove titles you no longer want to watch from the ""continue to watch"" list it would definitely be a nice feature to include so I won't have so many titles I no longer watch taking up unnecessary space..."
Ckavion Davis,It have the best show and new movies
ameerah morrison,I love it you can watch anything
kyra Begusa,It's a great app if your won't to watch good movies but the reason am giving it 2 stars is because when your watching a series after every episode there's an add its just really anoying and the adds are literally adds about buying Disney when your watching a movie or a series on disney its just so stupid I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have a add about disney after every episode when watching a series netflix says they have adds and I've only ever seen an add on there once please fix this.
Ives Ross,it's good it just crashes alot.
Victoria Bogoevski (Essentially an Empath),"We absolutely loved using Disney+ before the Hulu merge and letting our kids navigate the app which limited content we did not want them to have access to which can be found on Hulu. With the integration of both we constantly have to screen the suggested shows before allowing our kids access to the app. You cannot ""remove from list"" for suggestions that we do *not* want for us or for kids. I loved when the apps were separate. We felt safe allowing our kids to feel some sense of autonomy to chose"
Michelle P,good darn movie
JJ AD,"I love the movie WISH, Percy Jackson and the Olympians. It is GREAT!"
Marsal Martinez,"I can see my series on my PC, but the app is terrible"
Kim Duffy,I cannot watch any thing on my phone keeps saying update and going back to the downloads
yuliya ko,they have good movies butwhen I go down to see I updated nothing happened soI'm never going to watch it again
Hadiyah Namutebi,It is nice and all but can't download anything
Trina Atkinson,Brilliant app having trouble updating though so brilliant is a term ill leave for now
Cory W,"It's ok, some good shows. But not all Disney shows are available. Not going to continue paying for the streaming service when I need to record the shows my kids want to watch from the Disney junior TV channel. Pointless."
Paris Sinett,"Its not terrible, but it could be better. There's no organizing your watch list. no mini player. The progress bar is too close to the edge of the screen so pulling up device menus often accidentally skips you around your movie. Not everything is available year round. Some lag problems, and doesn't always retain my spot in a show or movie. (Edit 4/24) Watchlist no longer displays more than a certain number of the most recent additions to it"
Kymir,"Disney+ is great, but I think it will be a good idea to being back bunk'd. It's a really good show, and even if it long, I still like it. So can you pls consider being back bunk'd. By kymir Five stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
Benjamin Dada,U guys charged me twice for the same thing.
Azariya Anderson,Can't watch more than 2 episodes without there being an error and having to restart the app which takes almost 10 minutes for it to load. There's a lot of shows and movies that the app won't let me watch at all because it will never load. I'm paying for something that doesn't even work! Not impressed at all!
Benji Egan,Love
Neil Bradfield,great app
Hannah M,Slow to buffer
Tania Fraga Narea,"La aplicaci√≥n deja mucho que desear.. hay peque√±os detalles que ayudan a la navegaci√≥n, por ejemplo; poder acceder a la informaci√≥n de la serie/pel√≠cula desde la misma serie, al igual poder ver la lista de episodios. En fin, les falta todav√≠a"
John Geronazzo,Seems good for now would like to see the same reliability as other streaming services
Savanna Barclay,It has a lot of great movies and shows from my childhood.
Mandy Richardson,"I absolutely love using Disney+. I can now watch it on my television. I get a better picture when I watch it on my television. However, it hasn't been updating recommendations from the previous film I watched but I'm still able to watch films. For example, I watch Enchanted, and it brings up suggestions of what to watch next, but it seems to have stopped updating my recommendations of what to watch next. How can it be fixed."
Keysi Perez,"ANIME IS HEREEEE, ALSO A BUNCH OF OTHER ADDITIONS I CANT BELIEVE IT"
nate reed,it sucks. because every one has to pay for it 2 stars
Justin Wilcox,"Website forces you to download app which can't actually log in to, just to enable content you're already paying for. Stop forcing people to use garbage web apps developed by cheap offshore companies when they don't even work."
crab cakes,"There should be a way to adjust playback speed. I HATE watching shows at anything slower than 1.25, and I want to ENJOY my shows."
Tahlee Lonebear,If they up the prices one more time I'm just gonna go ahead and cancel my subscription and so is my sister were gonna be apart of the streaming boycott
rochelle castrence,No longer kid safe on the home page. We need options to change the view on the front page and add a find button to other views. Hulu needs to stay on it own app.
Ronald Munhangu,Great app. loads of content
Ezekiel Overstreet,"What a joke, doubling your price and adding ads"
Victoria Wilds,it's amazing
Lisa McLaughlin,okay
Gary McCallum,"The only positive is ""their"" old school content Oh Disney....how the mighty have fallen. Lay of politics & culture wars & sack the blue haired uni radicalised kids with ZERO life experience. And the ESG (almost Chinese social credits) score card cannot be worth your stock price tanking? Get back to doing what WD was great at, telling magical stories for the whole family (not just the weird black sheep) Marvel is now awful & your trying to convert kids to think like Hollyweirdo Yanks. Sick!"

Luna Eclipse,Would be great if it stop to buffer every 2 seconds in the middle of a movie or TV show fix the issues disney like I feel like I'm being ripped off.
Jerry Lehman,"A lot of options for movies, shows, etc. It also has helpful tools to navigate quicker. Plus, they always have the latest movie or show, which is kinda nice."
Man Montez,Disney+
Luca Graziano,Loved this film!
Traci Folks (Hustle),Shout out my son KJ üíô
Tamir Weintraub,"I've never had so much trouble using streaming apps as much as this one. It's the worst! I'm always having connectivity issues (with this app), it takes at least one minute into an episode before it finishes buffering and starts to play smoothly, and when I want to skip ahead or go back, it takes so long to buffer again! I rarely post reviews, but I've been using and dealing with this app long enough to warrant a poor review."
CheekyCheeseBurgerBuns,"Great selection of shows. But the app (at least for mobile) could use some work. It always buffers, pretty much randomly, but independent of your internet connection. If I close and restart the app, the problem disappears for a while, then comes back. Pretty disappointing from the disney dream machine. Eh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Rob H,hard to find watchlists and cannot remove from continue watching.
Aaron 0_o,"Not even talking about disney as a company, this app works horribly. Everytime you download something for a long train ride you will find a new unknown error which prevents you from actually playing said downloads. This makes this pretty much unusable(i currently also can not stream video with Wifi). I also have the latet software updates and everything"
K Reviews,It is almost impossinle for me to connect to ESPN+ on my SMART TV. Why isn't there a link to it on the Disney+ page? I pay for it through Disney. Very disappointed and irritated
Paul Cree,"I really enjoy the programmes, but I wish you could have the option to remove things off the ""continue watching"" tab"

Katelyn Koplan,Having to disconnect and reconnect just to change what you are watching is annoying.
Man In Shorts Jane,Awesome

Magdalena,What's wrong with this app? Skips to the next episode in middle of the curent one. And when I press play it plays the previous episode from the...end. This is disturbing! Please fix it! Tnx

Fualaau Faatau Falanaipupu,The App was good until lately the app starts to loop and freeze
JS Noto,No problems whatsoever! Easy and fun to use!
Matej Hlatk√Ω,"A lof content to choose from and to watch. Pricing is reasonable. The problem is Android app itself: - slow search speed - sometimes cannot cast / resume show b/c ""it's not available in my country""; however can watch on this device or cast from iPhone in same household - ""continue watching"" - rarely works as intended; movie is played from the start most of the time - multiple taps of ""fast backward"" totally screw the time and jump forward"
Tobias Skovgaard Jepsen,The integration with Google TV on Chromecast is excellent and the content is superb.
kevin oconnor,App is subpar.
Stuart Gee,"I think I""ve been taken advantage of, emails, & hardware! Great easy too use app though,STU, Good stuff too watch on Disney channel. Thanks"

Muminjon Abduraimov,The Fu#@ wrong with the registration

Jason Green,I love it it's so easy to use
Jaeson Nomad,(1) No option to remove item from Continue Watching (2) Watchlist capped at 50 items (3) Can NOT Change Playback speed
Derek Fregeau,The app was better before recent updates. Now offline videos have issues such as the kids profile won't load them and you can't switch profiles without Internet. They took a pretty good app and broke it. Support said it's by design though
Kellie Jackson,Love it
Gary,Crashes constantly to make you watch ads.
John Heaney,never works properly.
Robert Bisson,"Something that has been watched, and attempts to be viewed again, will pick up at the end of the episode. So much so that we can't rewatch the first episode of some things because it will go straight to the next episode countdown. Great when my kids love to rewatch stuff and it goes through 5 episodes in 5 minutes because they all went straight to the end of the next episode. How does a kid-centric company not understand that kids rewatch things incessantly? Wonder why subscriptions struggle?"

N.,I don't know what you guys did in the last 3-4 months but the app used to cast perfectly but now it's a mess and inconsistent. Do better.
Nomad Grappler,I can't give a monopoly a good review.

Ironclad Brad,"it's not bad, if you have season 5 episode 3 of a show downloaded and you watch episode 2 season 1. it will autoplay and jump four seasons"
Wolkenphoenix,"Regardless of the content on disney plus, the app itself is rather bad. Crashes, QoL issues (like downloaded material still streamed if not explicitly started on the download page) and no increase video speed option among many other things (see other reviews)."
Cindy Koehler,Not installing properly
Michael De Tomaso,worth at least a trial session

Roxanne crazy,"It has most of the movies you want, but it has serious problems with the error 39, especially when offline. I've had to delete the app multiple times and redownload it, just for all my downloaded movies to be deleted. I cannot download them anymore till I'm back home. Please fix this"
Leona Mathilde,"My only complaint is that there have always been some trouble with offline downloads, they've never worked correctly"

Hank Haskell,"Keeps saying ""we're having trouble playing this"" it's been doing it to everything. i have working wifi"
Kay Kase,It's really good for me I just use it for my phone although it's really good on is 5 star
Jaziel Williams,I like Disney puls but they need to add a simpler way to remove shows from continue watching like since Disney's merging Hulu and + together they should add the Hulu poof to Disney + also a drag and drop feature for the watch list üòâüëç
Emanuel Vazquez,"ads. I paid $17 to get ads out of hulu, why couldn't it have included add removal for Disney+, as well?! why pay an extra $20 more for that?!"
Sylvia Boakye,Is very good
Stephen Buchanan,"The content is fine, but the TV app has a TERRIBLE audio issue. Not everyone has a surround sound system! myThere should be an option to select an ordinary stereo mix! I KNOW it exists, because sound is perfectly fine on a mobile device (e.g. with headphones). But on TV, it is almost impossible to watch movies because dialogue is incredibly soft and, even worse, has a constant hollow phasing/flanger sound throughout. Please fix the audio settings, Disney!"
Chris Creger,Garbage idk how to set up
Esther Yuward,it's a wonderful app but Hulu could be free
Kaiy's Place,"It's a good app, but the picture to picture isn't working and I don't know why"

Brenda Davis,üî•
Chantal Poirier,Hoe do I reactivate my disney+?
Bryan Stringham,I want a way to not display disturbing or age inappropriate material for my children when the app shows up. I want to be able to filter by age and by specific titles.
Evan Watts,Great shows and good for kids as well
solange cuevas-roblero,love it
Abdulaziz Mohammed,Not good for human beings
Al Low_,I'm loving it
Michael Woods,"Since the ads, it doesn't save where I left off."
Dean Newton,"I already canceled my subscription because the price was too high, and I just got an email stating it's going up another $30. Definitely glad I cancelled. I only watch Star Wars content so it's just not worth it anymore. With the amount I've spent on my subscription for the past couple years I could have just purchased all the seasons of every Star Wars show. Also, the user interface needs work."
Paul Brammer,Disney Plus worked fine until they tried to do an update and no longer works on mySony TV with Google.update says it needs Android but I have a Sony TV so do not know why that is the case. if Disney doesn't fix this in the next few days I'm going to cancel and tell everyone I know to cancel

Don Stewart,"I WANT OUT AND IT WONT LET ME!! I don't want to update my payment details and have been trying to unsubscribe for the last 30mins and it's actively waiting for money to drop into the bank account I used to pay for my online subs, there is only the options to A: update my bank details B: Refresh the page or C: To log out. It also won't let me get to my account details directly, so I can actually unsubscribe. Every year there's some sort of foolishness, so disappointing."
Ja√ße Selkirk,Cool I pay for a day it's awesome
Rose welsh,"Brilliant, keep the good films, coming ."
Olivia,q hello world I am hank mores I like this app √§√§√§
Lu√≠s Cruz-Filipe,Newest update includes stupid overlays covering subtitles. This app just keeps getting worse. Casting to a Chromecast does not work properly. The screen freezes all the time and it takes several attempts to be able to start casting.

Joe West,why the price change??
greg smith,can someone explain to me how you don't honor the 7.99 bundle ad that say you get Hulu also? when I called your support to fix problem they told me to call google and then he had me cancel my subscription and told me to wait a month and subscribe again for 9.99. or subscribe to Hulu now.
Patrick Hanson,I just did the dio for hulu and Disney plus with no adds and it will not let me watch hulu I have to pay for another account for hulu at 17.99 on top of the 19.99 for the dio. Please help... I'd give a 5 star is this was actually true tho the Disney Plus app...
Smitty Johnson,"App just randomly stopped working today. Would load, then 'un-load' the screen & go blank...? App is so broken. Disney+ is quite racist by only having 1 cultural category ~ BLACK. They have also made me create a new password 3 times. Stop Disney!"
Daniel Hayes,"this app is ridiculous it takes me atleast 5 tries minimum just to get something to load without it returning to the main screen, not impressed..."
Ilham Izyan Bin Abdul Rahman,Can U add Big City Greens S4 + more episodes of S3 Pls? And can U add The Buzz On Maggie on Disney+ as well?

Lisa Cole Vlas,You stink! Thanks for forcing me to download the App for something I pay a monthly fee for on to my tablet that is pressed for memory when I used to be able to just login and stream on the Internet. I am so tired of your money grubbing tactics.
AUBREY SKIBIK,ITS GOOD AND ALL THEY NEED MORE KPOP SHOWS LIKE ENHYPEN OR BTS AND BLACK PINK AND MORE HOT GUYS WITH NO SHIRT ON

Tracey Jones,"wish is really bad, the first song the male bad guy sings is move for move chorography for let it go, they've recycled there content so much they can't tell the difference they use to make good cartoons, but now they have people who all learned the same thing everything is the same recycled story or animation. Disney movies use to be beautifully done it was gorgeous my kids don't watch the new stuff they want to dive opiniond in there face and cancel good cartoons like star, owl house, amphibian"
Eve Herzberg,top
Mart√≠n Nicol√°s Pugnale,"The app can be very slow sometimes, plus using it with a chromecast is a nightmare."

Mark Brannan,all the best shows and movies. ads are a bit long though.
Fred Lillie,I love Disney and Hulu.
Wiebe Geus,the app is bad. casting glitches Out the app and or your phone. when casting you can't switch series without uncasting and recasting. on your phone whenever it's a darker lit series or movie you can not see. bathing without full open brightness. love the stuff on Disney but the app is the utmost worst
Heaven Midoriya,love to watch movies on the go and this is perfect on any device
Chris Lacklison,"Fantastic, great programmes and films and lots in Dolby Atmos & Vision, but unfortunately ""Air Crash Investigation"" has been removed in the UK, otherwise it would have been 5 stars."
Alonzo rMf Orozco,"I love this app for my grandkids and myself. Cartoons, movies for kids and adults. Documentaries as well."
Bailey Musiol,"Terrible to use, crashes all the time"
geegaravano,So many glitches.. don't understand how they can charge for this. Rarely use it because of the so many glitches with streaming. Disney is such a big name surely they can develop a worth while app. Will be cancelling today. Don't waste your money.

Melissa Novak,beautiful imagery!
Orion Colon,"on console ps4/ps5. The playback will not select the correct video when trying to scroll down. For example if a show has 2 season. You will have to re-select a different season to refresh the page, otherwise the episode you select will be the wrong episode. If you don't have multiple season you seem out of luck as you have to manually rewind during playback to see previous episodes if it's glitching. Restarting, reinstalling and checking for updates has not helped so far. Please fix this."
Bill Chan,"I can't open the apps, your apps is trash"
Charmaine Westhorpe,"Suddenly freezes, won't load & cuts out all the time! If it wasn't for the fact that it's the only app that has the shows my son likes. I would have deleted it a long time ago! It used to be fantastic, but in the last couple of months, it's been ridiculous!!! Especially when you're paying $18 a month to not be able to watch anything or spend half your night trying to get it to work!!!"
Nick Vaughan,"I love this app, but I'm what world should my 3 year old have to see ""Freaknik"" with barely dressed people and a brutal murdering show about samurai on the front page. The target audience is children not people who should use Hulu as well."
Libby Commons,Shithouse can't cancel subscription after price hike making it hard to cancel
Beatrice Park,rubbish .
Mark Foster,üëçüèªüëåüèª
J Chan,Absolutely a garbage app. Yeah I didn't download it to my phone. But on my fire stick I have it. It takes probably 20 times the length of time for it to load up compared to something like YouTube. Shows that I want to keep it on will refresh and go back to the home screen. Showcasing shows or movies I don't want my toddler to watch. And naturally my kid wants to watch them. How about the addition of hiding shows and movies? That would help solve a lot of these issues. I'll delete eventually.
Ruben Yambot,Entertainment
D A,unstable. constantly loops. won't let me play downloads.
Steve Procter,there's so much variety on Disney plus I love all the options you can get the movies shows and more.if there was something negative about this app it would probably be that there are a lot of playback issues and glitches that I would love to be fixed.totally recommended one of the best movie streaming services I've ever had thank you
Essential Designs London,Disney has such a wide variety of movies . It is amazing!
Trisha Bojan,always have trouble with this app to play movies or cast them. never have issues with any other platform.
Mark Gardner,great family friendly app with good choice movies and shows
Michelle Tiffany Nirmalan,This would be a good app except that it buffers every 5 minutes. On every platform. Also happens to so many people. Sometimes even just shuts down.
The Multiverse,"Trying to watch older shows such as family guy and the good doctor reveals that there's several cut segments. The show gets near where a commercial break would have been and cuts the last 10-15 minutes from that section and just skips ahead to the next section. Characters in mid dialogue are cut off completely and major plot point reveals are skipped entirely. This is not entertaining, this is frustrating beyond words. Many key points are omitted and I'm left not even wanting to watch anymore."
Robert Morton,Dolby Digital plus not working on Sony 65x900f only getting stereo 2.0 audio
Axel L,pretty good
Tim Neufeld,No good content anymore. I canceled my subscription and won't go back.
Jennifer Bohannon,(Not Jennifer) I'm only here to watch Ratatouille.
Shaun Watt,Obscenely priced for what you get. Ads ads and more ads. Watch through an ad blocker browser if you must have your disneyflix.
Elisha Moncivaiz,"I'm already paying a subscription fee for the application. Why do I have to watch advertisements like this is Television? At this rate, I'd rather pirate the movies and say to hell with streaming all together."
LeeAnn Mollenido,love iiiiiiiiit!!!!!

Edward Duda,Disney+ is one of my all time favorite streaming apps because I love the Disney and Pixar movies and Marvel movies which I love action and I also love Star Wars movies too because they are amazing and I even do love National Geographic it's fun to learn about animals when I watch it too üòÉ
Lydia Benschneider,"I don't know why people are saying this app doesn't work because it is the best app I love it but people are saying it doesn't work, well they're wrong because it might be their Internet and they shouldn't just make a bad review. It is really rude and mean because it also could be a glitch in THEIR Internet because I've never had any problems so they should stop giving this bad reviews! This app is awesome!!!"
Zaiden Jones,very cool
Brittney Christianson,"Why the hell would you add hulu stuff onto the app??? Disney+ is supposed to be a safe app that my kids can watch anything on. Not anymore! I will not be renewing my subscription next time. I know many parents who feel this way. So disappointing!! And no, the kids version doesn't even have all the movies on it so it's pointless"
anthony laurenzana,I thank Disney should buy HBO?
Holly Johnson,"App keeps crashing both on mobile device and on home devices (TV, ect.)."
Ruben Webster,Great
Jeanette Jones,great quality streaming
C *,"When i can use the app, 5 STARS So I've gone so far as to un-installed, to everything while refreshing my butt off to no avail üòû normally you guys are transferred the cash monthly. This time, I am prompted to pay, and many attempts later, I'm prompted with errors or that I am to fault in some way. Even on your website, the page is continuously trying to reload with the circle going round & round. Please help! Fam jams everywhere enjoy move night"

Freya Donaldson,"It has great shows, but if you are a family with anything over 2 people or 4 people with premium then you cannot even watch those shows. Also, when was this new policy implemented because none of my family found out until today when I tried to use it and couldn't. It is too bad that disney+ is going the same way as Netflix cause now both suck."
HJ Brack,an incredible way to stream all of disneyd latest realeases
Ken Herrod,"All is good, fair amount of use for a fair price."
n_fs_k,most of the timeit's not working properly.there are manyshows that don't follow up the subtitles orthere's no video just the audio.it's buzzing most of the timeand it gets really really slow .and this happens very often despite nothing is running in the background.I'm using the app for almost a year .I'm not satisfied the last 4 months
JustCallMeAngel Harvey,I love being able to watch some wholesome good guy bad guy story line and be able to cheer at the end when the good guy wins!!! üòÅ
David James bernard Whittaker,Excellent
Captain Cynical (Captain cynical),I can't even even update my payment. It just loads and glitches between windows.
sarron beverly,Trash now stupid ads raised prices! Save your money still the same old movies from day1
Simon Gibson,"Shogun is in my opinion, worthy of 5 stars. I think the acting is superb & can't wait for the next episode. We have seen Disney taking some knocks recently, I thought they were down and out, what a comeback."
Ben Pritchett,"The login process for this app and streaming using a TV app are atrocious. Everytime our family needs to reauthenticate (which is very often in a house with multiple TVs and users), it's required to reset your password. We don't share an account with anyone outside our household. It's to the point where every week we want to watch something on Disney+, we have to hop through 10 minutes of credential testing and resetting, to the point where we generally just cancel for a few months."
Jonas Rende,"The content is great but the app is complete trash. It doesn't remember where I left off. Most of the time it doesent even remeber what episode I was at. There app for Nvidia shield is better, not great but better. You have no rating system which suck sine I dont get any use full recomendations or for that matte know if I have seen something already. Atleast add some feature to know if I've seen something before or not or better jet the before mentiond rating system. A +1 and -1 would suffice."
Heather Evans,love it...:)
Cian_curley074,"great, It just needs more action movies"
t m,"not specific to the app but the website and TV Apps too as well, I wish there was less loading time for everything you do on Disney plus. it'll definitely up the experience better. Shogun rocks"

Nathaniel Betts,It's too difficult to cancel espn+ Crooks!
Ariadne Garcia,The best movie app ever. Makes old movies have better quality. Another great thing home of Star Wars movies
Barak Kirchner,I really enjoy watching Disney Plus it has a lot of my favorite movies on it that I grew up watching unless I buy the DVD I'm not going to get to watch them send this day and age so thank you for bringing them 2 me again

Jamie Mom,For my zaylee again (I put one star because it has to be more greater than what low price it is grande Royale double 0z7
Josh Johnson (McSquiggins),"App was great when I got it almost 3 years ago. Now it is a giant pile of cow dung. I am happy that I unistalled this app. A multi-million dollar company, and this is the best that they can do? ü´§"
Brian Spires,"It would be nice to have something in place for removing things from continue watching list. There have been times i have been watching a series then stopped watching because its not for me, then can't remove it. Why?"
Eric Whitaker,Wonderful
Fing Car,"I paid yearly and was paying $109 and got an email that now the next bill price is $139!! A $30 increase. For what?! I would rather spend that money somewhere else. Not worth it, for they have."
Tiffany Booshu,Excellent!

Daniel Collar,One of the best shows ever!
daniel mendoza,falls continuos
Carole O,"Starts the movie over if you happen to pause and come back later, and doesn't have an option to skip credits at end... I feel like VCR's are literally better than this app. Also super slow to load, especially when hitting the back/forward 10 seconds buttons. You would think Disney would have their act together."
Ava Muir,i love it and amassing i get to see movies from my childhood
Sonora Manchester,there's ads now.
Gregg Geiser,great streaming service the marvel section is where I spend most my time at any given point I can find a movie I wanna watch and not spend a half hour looking for a movie like Netflix you can spend a half hour looking for something to watch just to change it halfway through
Brooklyn,good
Ellise Bourne,Doesn't chrome cast.
Jacob Nyquist (ErdeDrache),this application needs at least one developer for Android. not everyone uses iGarbage.
Kodi,the old house is a masterpiece the only thing about it that I don't like is that you had the audacity to cancel it
Suraj Rami,"5.1 and Dolby Atmos audio has been broken for almost a year now. Everything plays in stereo only. There have been no updates from Disney on ETA for fix, or if they are even going to fix. Update 4/8/24 - App was updated to a newer version with release notes stating they've made bug fixes and updates. 5.1 and Dolby Atmos audio still not working on my Sony TV. Cancelling subscription, never giving business again."
Joel Reed,Terrible when trying to chrome cast.
Christy Tony,üëå
Elizabeth Petersen,"Disney + is probably the worst performing streaming app I have... and I have a lot. Netflix, Paramount, Amazon, Peacock, YouTube, Starz and even the free ones like CW network and Pluto. It constantly crashes, won't load on phone or TV. Glitches out. Do not bother paying for it it's not worth it. I only have it because it's free with my Verizon account."
Eric Tippett,I love this.
charlie monger,Disney this is not your fault my TV won't install you
Susan Moses,"I'm trying to watch the newest Simpsons, but the menue is a nightmare to navigate. I have a masters degree, I am a member of mensa, but navigating to the newest episode of Simpsons seems harder to do. I don't want to ""skip to next episode "", one at a tine, they've got over 30 seasons, I want the new ones."
Eric Souza,"For some reason, whenever I try to cast a show to my TV, it will play the content just fine, vut will cause my phone to bug out, with the screen constantly flashing until I reboot my device. Even when rebooting, the content remains streaming, and I can't think of a single reason why a streaming service of all things could cause this, especially since it was working fine last Thursday."
James Eckelman,"Update: Fred needs to talk to the angels... - I've explained to you that I am like Jelly Roll. Yeah, I'm glad we talked about the productions for the various Disney programs, and the productions are really starting to utilize the ""Protagonistation,"" as an idea, of audiences into really building stories that people can fall in love with..."

Sandro Calleja,no saund
Malcolm Hirst,Won't let me update my payment info routes me to the site which has a seizure and bounces me between login and identity pages. Won't be changing this review if it's ever fixed because it's been almost a week.
Lacey Haslam,can be slow sometimes will start the episode or movie from start when in the middle but very good otherwise
Shane Mann,Good for Star Wars...when it works!

terry ward,keeps crashing and freezing. freezes during downloads then won't let me delete. have to uninstall and reinstall. very frustrating app. won't even let me download at all on my old tablet. new tablet still having issues.
Clive Thomas,won't update
Steve Brandes,It is obvious that Google is manipulating these reviews and star ratings. Nobody I know even watches Disney anymore yet they are trying to say that this app gets 4.5 stars? Absolute fake and manipulated reviews.
jon p,usability is lacking.
Terry Bob,too many dam commercials
Florentino Roman,2wa
Terrell Downing,"App randomly doesn't let me play or cast certain movies/series by saying ""not available in your region."""
Rocque Fernandes,a lot of great content
Teynqua Lyles,!.love it!.
Sheri Racine,love it.
Chole Rowe,"The app is... Spasming(?) almost and is causing my phone to go on the frits immediately after opening the application. Nothing else triggers it. Just Disney plus. The phone itself is brand new just bought yesterday this shouldn't be an issue. But long short, I open Disney and my screen starts flashing, heavy lag on all screen movements, keyboard randomly coming and going, screen flashing on and off, keyboard won't type disappears when attempting to use it but can't be gotten rid of when not"
Gary Olp,"It's unbelievable that you can pay monthly for this service and still have to deal with ads. 30 dollars a month, yet I still have to skip ads before my kids can watch a show. Despicable in my opinion, and we're looking for alternatives."
Thomas Light,"Lots to chose from, and more added all the time."
Mark P,"do not play ads for your failed movie ""wish""... this is a paid service that should be AD free."
Joseph Winton,How come I'm paying $13.99 but I still have ads on my movies and shows?
Brittany Young,I still get ads üò°üò°
Helen Hilton,"Good app, I have been watching quite a bit, and I'm so happy to be able to watch NCIS from eh beginning. There is 1 problem, though, some of the episodes are out of order and not just on NCIS"
Harman Gill,good content from FX
serg obeid,They lie on religion stories
toluwa,Domain Expansion: Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
asim,üçâ
Michael Travis,always says region issues. not worth the money or hassles!
Amid,good fun
Sebastian Dudek,is very good to watch your favourite classic Disney movie on this app
Scardy Charles,Does not work on my ps4 or my Samsung smart TV.. it only works on my phone
Zahid Islam,"Great content, shame they still lag years behind any other streaming app. Not all series have skip intro/recap buttons and the timer is way too long, no picture in picture support. Can't go onto a series from recently watched and choose an episode, you have to play from wherever you were if you want to choose an episode, you need to manually search for the series and then go all the way through the ep list to get to where you were - other competing services have none of these issues at all"
Tom,It is deffently interesting
Yolanda Romero,I'm unable to update my payment why
Maryann Nash,"Love the Disney+ app! Everything works perfectly on my Android. Haven't connected it to my TV, but works great on my laptop!"
Marcus Van Sciver,AWESOME
Gene Miller,Awesome library of quality movies!
Haleigh Kline,not letting me update

Jennifer Barringhaus,please don't let anyone see my account or name
Isaac Webster,idk
Google Box,Won't run without an update but there's no update available. Says it's already the latest version. Epic fail.
Lola Lola,The app was working great then when I was trying to update my payment it kept jumping around like CRAZY!!!! WHATS GOING ON WITH IT?????
Matthew Manger,This app works like a dream I would totally recommend it to my friends and family.
Corey Ogburn,"Disney, you're too big to have this bad an app experience. Why is it so hard to tell what episode is playing while I'm casting?"
ashley stotts,Where is ESPN?! WHY AM I HAVING TO FIND IT ELSEWHERE!
Mahdi Rufee (Masedi),The Best Ever
Jenifer Meyers,Terribly made app
Ryan Blue,"I turn to Disney + mostly for the trip down nostalgia lane. To embrace the warmth from these timeless memories I call tv shows, is something I look forward to every evening."
Shellie ‚ÄúRachelle‚Äù Thompson,Constantly logs me out and says the password is wrong when I know for a fact it's not. The constant login hassle is not worth the subscription fee. I love disney movies but the idea of going through the login is such a turn off to watching a disney movie.
Derrick T Weston,I contacted Disney pmus to let them know that they had been double charging me for 2 different packages. And even though they saw that they were double charging me. They promised to refund a portion of my money and stop the double charging. Now I see my bill and they're still doing it I hope.to resolve this as quick as possible.
brian stephens,Open the app and when you want to select a movie it just gets stuck on the loading screen and doesn't work anymore. I've cleared my cache and restarted the device and the app is up to date and still nothing. Disney sucks period.
James Miller,"App has degraded significantly as of late. When casting with smartcast, the audio cuts out for a second every minute. Additionally, to cast a new title, you have to end the current casting session. Apparently, it is incapable of switching, a base function every other streaming platform is capable of. Navigation is good, but nothing that sets it apart from others."
Camilo G√≥mez,pretty amazing app with Moto G32 International version :)
Real E.,I like how I can watch most Disney movies. Even old ones aired exclusively on Disney Channel. It is the best.
Emily Espinosa,"While I hardly don't ever use my app anymore, I thought I'd still get on here to leave a review. It really annoys me how it won't show everything I have on my list. Even on the TV I can't see everything I have. It's really annoying and frustrating because if I have something on my list but can't see it, then I have to go and look it up. It would just be a lot easier if I could see everything I have."
George Mulryan,is terrible when used offline
Luther Smith,I love Disney Plus update app open
John Catanese,Where is Hulu?
SheKnots ‚ÄúSheKnots Chats Creation‚Äù,most amazing thing I've ever seen
Adriano Ros,Login is slow and buggy (sometimes doesn't recognise my pin). Downloads don't always show up in the download section so have to scroll to relevant page for each programme or movie to find them. Stopping and starting programmes can be slow sometimes 10 seconds after you pause and press play to restart. When using the app to download content for plane journeys it often won't play shows that have been downloaded. Really unreliable.
Allen Smith,I have a ¬£1600 Sony Xperia 1 mkV that displays Natively at 4k 120fps. Has HDR full Dolby Atmos and Audio 360. But for some reason this useless app decides I can't have 4k resolution on my phone despite having it on my previous 5 year old Xperia 1 MK2 since Disney plus launched. Amateur attempt at an app at best
Nathan Squires,I love the movies and shows üòÄüòçüòÅ
Star Woman,"Disappointed, it's should b just Disney videos. and no ads."
Sarita Lidle,there needs to be an option to remove things from your watch history & I don't need my small child able to view Hulu content as it circulates on this app. keep it under that specific tab or not at all!!!
Madeliene Morton,"Disgusting price increases without increasing what is provided. Dirty, sneaky business, GREEDY CORPORATION!!!!"
Jasmine Holmes,app doesn't always work
Deangelo Smith-shaw,"Great app. All my favorite movies, and shows are on here. I recommend getting this app it's not for free tho but it's worth spending the money. One of the best streaming apps to use. Netflix is one of the best streaming apps too. I strongly recommend getting the app."
michael francis,Good app just has a lot of updates
Joe Fields,Good content but the app itself is garbage
Tage Ueland,"The app sometimes has buffering issues even with downloaded content. Reinstalling seems to be the only fix. The recent UI color change was unneccesary, especially considering that they chose the ugliest blue/green color. The available movies and shows however are very good."
Joseph Gibbs,"Worst app ever This i literally the worst app for streaming. How has this massive multibillion ¬£ company not got this right. App freezes, closes, doesn't remember where you were man the list is endless. NOW TV is better, NETFLIX is better, AMAZON is better, APPLE is better. PARAMOUNT is better, Disney doesn't even come close. Sort it out what a waste"
Vicky gilraine,amazing movies anytime you want
Sara Jardine,"Content is okay. 3+ years and this app still can't remove from continue watching. When I finish something it just sits in the continue watching portion. it's cluttered, ugly and annoying to look at."
Cindy Billiot,I like it since I can watch.Our half and other of my favorite shows
Oomairah Jaumeer,Its so good
Daniel Steen-Brungot,Buggy and bad UX
nova alyousef,gencide supporter.
Ben Walton,A lot of poor ui choices and unfortunate behavior. very unpolished.
Alison Ayam,love it
Tiana Harn,It would be higher if the video player didn't restart what you were watching just by pausing the episode or movie and then you can't fix you spot without restarting the app most of the time.
Kellen Beale,I personally love this app for watching anime and marvel movies such as Deadpool. I am watching jujutsu kaisen and it's amazing. and the ads aren't so common like other apps. You only get like 4 ads within 20-25 mins. 9.5/10 would recommend.
Charlotte Saunders,Its just so creative I love it!
Richard A. Cabrera,buggy on my JVC tv. it's closing automatically
Nicole Andre,"Why are there LIQUOR STORE commercials being played for every one of my Disney children shows?! I don't care if it's a child or adult account, there shouldn't be LIQUOR STORE commercials played during a child's rated G program. Do better Disney. App also forgets what you were watching or where in the show, so you have to sit through more commercials to find where you left off. If you rew a few seconds it makes you watch commercials before rewind and then after another 10 seconds of watching show"
Daniel Turner,"Content is good but the app itself is atrocious. Very few titles let you skip recaps or title scenes. Chromecast functionality is essentially non-existent, you can't even watch the next episode without watching/force skipping your way to through the end credits. Constantly losing your place in an episode if you leave the app. If you minimise the app then often it will have multiple instances of itself running."
J.C. Leviathan,"The app doesn't work on my phone now. I have a Samsung A52 5G and it was awesome before, now the app is useless."
ghost,Was supposed to be a free 1 montg trial so i ordered it and its charged me ¬£7.99 straight away!!! Wth
Jose Hernandez,I love this app bc they has Taylor Swiftüòäüòäüòä
Alan Vasquez,app keeps logging out most of my devices constantly forces me to reset my password now it won't even let me reset my password had too many for the past year and a half I'm done with this app.
Tyler White,The collab with Hulu has made the experience horrible. I get ads too many times in shows.
Candice Forrest,wonderful movies and I always can find something I love and enjoy watching. thanks for the wonderful experience and God bless you
Catharina Wolf,THe show Nelly Jackson has a lot of Black out spots. Really weird. Do u even watch this before u put it up?
Ashtin Nielson,It won't let me sign in to the account and everyone else can
Alice Alborough,hate the adverts
Azul Sketch,"It was entertaining until Disney decided to add in ads and paying extra to ""have an ad-free experience"""
Chris Mayo,Woke garbage!
Shamira Rodriguez,It's my happy place!
Laura Dullea,Love the multiple varieties of videos to choose from to watch for a decent price
Matt Fiery,No surround sound on Disney owned apps! insanely frustrating. I get surround on Netflix and Amazon with same setup...
A Google user,I HATE THIS! IM A KID TRYING TO BUY THIS STUPID APP AND I CANT BC MY MUM WONT BUY ME A BLOODY SUBSCRIPCTION.
C M Ellis,Great!!
Jacoba Rudder,Unknown and I don't want the money in my account if it will not work out what is happening 9‚Åπthe next time my baby will Brown or I have been on my own and will Brown in my life and land for me as a part time for is the only way alabama to make a decision about how the business can be in a relaxed and land environment can we get to know you all the way in your life with a great deal on your own business or the future for your own personal development or marketing strategy to make it work easier .
S. M,"Search and list building needs some work, but a great app otherwise and plenty to watch on D+"
Tamara Paris,The fact that you have started charging more for no ads is ridiculous. Signed back up and was giving 3 options each one kept going up. Now i just want to delete entire app. Its becoming ridiculous how much these channels have become Might as well just get cable n watch ads.
Bree Ward,It is a little bit too much for me üòû
Seci Mia,Boycotting
Miha Poteha,I love it so much because I could whach my fav movie decendants
Joseph Supreme,open Hulu live
eric crawford,Absolute trash recently. Continuously crashes and goes offline.
Tyler Stevens,Best streaming service available!
Patricia E.,Enjoyed the shows but couldn't stand to support a company funding genocide
A R,It won't even let me in the app and it got stuck on the loading page for 5 hours I left my phone for 5 hours and it was still stuck loading
Sophie van Halewijn,Ugly colour now
Thomas Newberry,This is the app I don't like since it glitches a lot
Ian,Go woke. Go broke
Christian Stassen,"The app on TV is by far the worst of all the major TV apps. Constantly lags, subtitles run behind, etc. Lots of work for Disney to do."
ALAPINO,"Magically, no content will load, download for offline viewing, or play any comment of any kind (aside from the 3 second intro). Menus and UI will load just fine, so I can see and interact with the things I am barred from watching. The content I paid to access, inaccessible. Typical remedial action/troubleshooting ineffective. At this point, I might start to take this personally."
Kyle Ellis (Coolpool1),The new color of the icon is a terrible color and you only did it because Hulu joined Disney plus which is only in the United States so why did you change the color for everybody change it back
Christelle Kernizan,Love this app.
Barbara King,awesome
Ruly Meza (Ruly),Keeps loging you out and have to reset your password
Rob,"Horrible, the App is glichy - that's an understatement."
Jennifer Stephens,"Since the upgrade, content loads incredibly slow, making everything unwatchable."
Marlon Ortiz,fun
Kenny Khaos,Explain the Sith As like Disney displays Jedi
Edward Mcauley,Always a good time. keep up the good work. Would like to see more Disney classics though.
Richard Wang,Absolutely trash switch between episode on TV series.
FirstCav Mom,"Think Disney+ is wholesome entertainment for your children? Think again. They have been attacking childhood innocence since Mr Disney passed, but offering movies like The Omen to children is an all-time low. Now that they've incorporated Hulu content into the Disney+ app, there's no telling what kind of garbage your children will be exposed to if left alone with it. The disgusting greed-at-any-cost philosophy has destroyed Walt Disney's legacy."
Grace Keith,I just really like the movie and show app
Brian White,I LOVE THIS APP. It has so many different features and shows! THANK YOU DISNEY PLUS!
Jonathan Mccary,good
Aaron Bougher,BEST OF THE BEST 2024
martha caicedo,"Nothing is new, old and borring programs and it doesn't let me unsubcrime."
Cass Dun,Used to love it but now they have a disney ad before every movie. Probably gonna try putting ads soon üòë
marissa milner,i love the movies and shows but the price increase is not fun if it increases again after this i dont know if ill be able to keep it.
Rebekka Brown,love it
Heather Mary,"Great content, but the app itself is terrible. It's unacceptable for a company with as many resources as Disney to have such a glitchy app."
Julia Paige Walton,I love it
Imani Robbins,"I don't know why you shrunk the Continue Watching rowing, now it's more difficult to spot because it blends with the other rows. I'm not happy about the ads of mixed Disney+ content. Very clustered looking app. Not organized well and not crazy about the interface"
Anthony Muro,I just love those show
Todd Schnell,won't update.they raised the price now it doesn't work
Mulenga Latim,"Doesn't represent a good investment. Greed has set in now and it's become bloody expensive. Taking customers for granted. Getting worse, since the update, the App doesn't work properly. Frustrating"
Dejan Pajoviƒá,"When Are you gonna fix the connectivity to a TV issue? It only allows via Wifi and sometimes looses that connection with a tv, so i need to reconnect. My other streaming apps work just fine."
Peter Fink,it's nice but I like Netflix better
Middle Child Jenn,"It's telling me to update the app, but it's no update available or happening when I click on it."
Jonathan Conlon,very good for streaming although ads pop up when u try to watch something but other than that it's great
Telepathy,The Statue of Liberty
Taylor Gabrielle,Movies skip when watching on a phone.
Chris w,Not the app but Greedy Disney keeps raising prices. Still takes too long to finish a movie when all my other apps work with a breeze. Don't know why I waste the money
Diana Kentzell,"Charge a day early, Not due till the 3rd of month I don't get paid till the 3rd. Insufficient funds on the second Do not charge till the 3rd."
Tiffeny Redfern,The app keeps refreshing and won't let me log in.
Glen Coghlan,Cmon Disney with all the money you have Surely you can ask Netflix or YouTube why there platforms play flawlessly does not continually buffer every minute and yours does It's not the device It's not the network It's the money out of my pocket I'm supposed to be able to sit and enjoy Enjoy what frustration I don't think I'll renew my subscription next year cause it has been like this since I subscribed I now know it's this APP
Mike,"I no longer recommend this app for young families. So not appropriate for children anymore. You have 2 choices ... kids account for 2 yrs and younger or rated R for kids 3 and up. Someone makes this make sense. The top featured row on this app is all adult material shows. My kids are frightened by some of the cover photos for the Hulu shows. Kids' accounts should go to 12, and stay traditional family safe selction of shows. Families with more than one child need more filter range of shows."

Daniel Patterson,I love it because of the eras tour swifty here
Aaron K,please fix your ratings system. I set my daughter's account to be PG and lower but when we click movies Morbious a PG13 movie that will scare her is the 3rd choice.
Espen Simpson,"I like how many options there are. From Marvel to Pixar, it fills my every need!"
Adam Mesler,it's amazing everything I want to watch in one place
Jennifer Toms,"App not playing movies on Android after update. Used to be able to watch fine on 4G but now it says not connected to Internet. Hulu and all other video apps still work great, just not Disney app"
James Manning,Very buggy. Almost everytime if you rewind or fast forward the app stops. If you need to go back to an episode you watched it sends you to a episode further in the season. Disney should fix those problems before working on cracking down on password sharing. Only good thing about this app is navigation.
David McInnis,doesn't use a lot of battery
Stanislav Stoev,I paid for 2 months but only 17 days Disney log me out and is asking to renew my membership
Alex Dacosta,This app is unfair it kick mi out of it and tell me to update it and there us no update until I can't go in again.
Clement k,Very bad interface compare to the Netflix app: -no previous/next episode button. -doesn't remember when you stop watching an episode. -Load of infinite loading.
Chef Cara,"I have auto play selected and it's not working. I've done all of the trouble that needs to be done. Clearing cache, unistalling, reinstalling, logging out, restarting my phone and yes the app is up to date"
Cameron Minnieweather,this is so bad my friend died from emotional damage
Grayson Screeney,it wants me to rate them after it stops working on my phone. but it is still a good app.
Aneta Monica,When I try to update payment the page keeps loading and get off the loading and all in loop making it unable to update payment.
Jens Asina,There is so much films to chose and al of them are sooooo funnnn its good for kids like omg so fun ‚ù§
Kent Rath,"It hasn't worked in 6 months, and everyone's excuse is that it's my internet, but it's funny because I have, Max, Peacock, and a couple other major streaming apps I use daily and they've never failed once!! While I've been paying for service and not being able to use it!! While I'd like to keep Disney, I feel I should be reimbursed for the last 6 months, I can't afford to pay for something that NEVER works."
Graeme Nisbet,it has great fun with the kids and adults and the girls and boys think it is incredible and I think it is fine.
Courtney Pazitka-Perry,The interface is not user friendly. Disney as a whole is a questionable corporation.
Vanessa Porter,"This is the worst streaming app out there. Shows are impossible to navigate because there are no forward buttons for the next episode. It is often very necessary to navigate to the next episode because it will not auto start the next episode . Can't navigate to the episode you want to when you are streaming and casting because 1. you don't know what episode you're on because the screen will not show you when you are casting, and 2 there is no forward buttons for the next ep. Two thumbs down."
Kwin Noel,App stops working
Steven Campbell,If you have multiple downloads in progress then it is common for it to produce an error even if it isn't a download you are trying to play. Downloads may never finish as well. If you use downloads then do 1 at a time.
Joseph Buehl jr,I love it no answer
No No Way,It will not update
Chand Ali,Good morning
Liza Trujillo-Frazer,What's going on? Do you want all Androids to uninstall your app? And cut services?
Kinsley Leite,it is soooooooooo much better than Netflix!!!!!!
Gabriel Guerrero,can't control hulu on mobile

TWIKI 14,Great it's got programs that I thought I wouldn't see again
Ron Schoonmaker,Needed the app cuz won't run in Chrome on tablets. Won't download.
RB Zae,great speed and variety
Paco Secada,Each update has awful glitches and breaking bugs. We have to untether our phone to our Chromecast just to change shows or episodes and a majority of shows will not stream due to errors. I feel that this has been a reoccurring for the past six months. Whatever rebasing they did for their code base for this app really borked something.
Jessica Redmond,best app to watch Gravity Falls and Hulu is the worst
Alison Drayton,Love the variety of shows and movies to watch. Also that your not cut off straight away when payment is just a couple days late
Melissa Hove,What is happening? Why is what should be a family friendly streaming app now have shows like American Horror Stories? Not impressed at all by the content. Just seems to be going down hill as the price soars. I guess it's time to delete.
Rob M,Changed plans since Hulu is included with TMobile and was never told the legacy plan had dolby where the new ads plan only has 5.1. now everything sounds horrible and no one can fix it
Annemarie Therese King,Chrome casting it is a nightmare. Our subscription will not be renewed at the end of the term.
Martin Blyth,getting expensive

Rebecca Brown,it keeps skipping episodes or going way to episodes I have already seen never gets the right one üòí

Jason Smith,it's going to just upgrade your internet
Costel Maxim Joker,nice
Debbie Guntzel,Disney plus
Amy Coultherd,Keep getting error code 39 on phone app. Never lets me watch stuff now on phone app.
Bakaua Kautebiri,Doesn't have the movie that I wanted to watch
Paul Cunningham,"Great for kids , not bad for adults"
Warren Honey,"Sorry but Disney+ TV application version is not very good keeps blinking every 5sec, Needs simpler menu & more control over picture quality playback/playing, Smoother loading & buffing."
Brooke ‚ÄúLyneye‚Äù H,After the march 26th update app wont get past the first loading screen
Juliet Carter,"Glitchy, loses connection, loses place in programme, stops play, can't load different series without disconnecting from chromecast"
Skylar Cloud,Y'all get enough money. Stop charging more and more. The video player for the movies barely works anyways.
David,like it
Jeremy Jones,Can't restart my subscription leaves me on a blank page after I select payment method and hit continue
Trinity Thomas,"You would think, with how big of a brand Disney is, that their streaming services would be one of the better ones, right? NO! Because apparently, for whatever reason, it would seem that this app will only crash. I loved it at first. I didn't have any issues, but then it crashed and won't play any of the movies or shows, I'll GLADLY change this to a five-star if it gets fixed.üòê"
Matthew Griffin,"Spams the ""Continue Watching"" section on Google TV with entries I've already watched, and re-adds them over and over even after setting them Hidden."
David Gutierrez,Si dejo de ver una pel√≠cula se reinicia y cuando muevo el indicador de tiempo no me marca en donde voy y nunca la puedo regresar al mismo lugar.
Amanda Cantu,"Not compatible with my Vizio Comcast TV after it decided it was time for an update. Very disappointed. It directed me to Google play for help fixing the problem and all it said was try updating the device, which is fully updated. No help at all."
Michael Caballero,I can bearly find what I'm looking for and now I'm gonna have to make a new subscription to watch my favorite shows not cool.
Ivan Ascott,sucks_
Ja ke,Bad scam me ü§Æ
Egyptian Goddess,"What really bothers me about how I have to keep having to log in. Why is it that I have to use a code absolutely every time? Why is it that there is no remember my password option? Why do we have to put in a whole separate URL, then add a code to end up having to put our password which is what shouldn't happened initially like every other normal app?! It's sooo annoying I am my children have begun to dislike the app and I'm considering cancelation."

Selene Davis,It's so great at people get to watch there favorite shows and movies.
Tina Pedroza,"There's Always a problem with Disney plus it either. Won't let you sign in and you have to recreate a new password, which is a pain in the butt. Or English is always saying there's an era. Or there's always a black screen. Now I'm having the same issues with Hulu, which I heard Disney bought out hulu. What is going on? It's getting to the point right fix in the cancel all these subscriptions"
Stella Bean,"Amazing, lots of movies to enjoy with family. Although some bugs it's Amazing"
Aurelia Marlow,The best
M Sheehy,Where the f... is the espn+ that is part of the Disney package that I have been paying for for well over a year and have not been able to use at all?? Worthless app ever!
Isaac Babash,I loved the eras tour ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüéµ
Lauren Jonson,good
Marian Luckenbill,"Easy to find the episode I wanted to watch. Too many commercials and not able to fast forward through them. Otherwise, I would use this again when the President's speech interrupts my show."
Mark Mitchell,"ABC used to be great app. But, lately it's trashed and now we can't watch the final season of Station 19"
p cox,"New update is trash just keep loading. Uninstalled, reinstalled. Nothing UPDATE 4/16/24 I have contacted customer service and for over 2 weeks now I have not been able to watch live tv.

Ian Palmer,"doesn't work in split screen even though every other app figured this out 5 years ago. also the Android TV version, the player never works."

Don Thomas,"Keeps stopping, won't play at times, locks up"
Stephanie Imarhia,"Best, app ever."
Juli Boatwright,Works well
Alison Milne,Well I was starting a Will Trent episode and mistakenly hit the fast forward button. This POS app will not let me rewind the show. Not a joke. Absolutely unreal. Un effing real. Guess I'll set an alarm to watch Will Trent instead of using this garbage app.
Judy Howe,Since you require having cable in order to watch your app. I have gone with other ways of watching the 3 things I do watch that is on abc. Cable is way to expensive. And the apps I have that's free. The 3 things I do watch I can watch on my other apps. So good luck with no one watching anything on abc. You lost me and a few thousand other people. And they can find movie and tv apps to watch the very few things that are good on abc. Good luck
Dawn Thomas,It won't open up just spins and spins
Realdog Brown,Very good app I like it because it has local news

Nan Mulligan,Will not open on my tablet. Screen is just black.
Jason Frederoski,"GARBAGE. Just delete, hopefully can watch NBA thru ESPN app. probably a money grab. have 2 pay for ESPN+"

Lisa Patterson,It's same you have to pay this app
TAMARA CABRERA,The streaming is terrible I keep losing signal in the middle of anything I'm watching is taking me 5 minutes to leave this because we keep losing

Loretta Mueller,Great
Herbert.G.,Good üëç
Raymond Evans,Good
Eli Stup,"This app sucks. There is no reason you shouldn't be able to view content with a Disney+ or Hulu subscription...we have both. You need to get into the 21st century. I do not have a TV provider...if I did I would have no interest in the app, I would be watching through them."
Christian Marcotte,Way to choppy no matter what I do nothing fixes the problem
Napoleon Glenn,5star

Danny Danny,Please restore.
CheriBomzArt (CheriBom),Many good shows! App Great to use when I miss a show.

Cassie Bryant,Just downloaded so I can watch the rookie on Feb 20th
Jeremy Jedlicka,"They now ""don't support"" networks that use proxies or VPN. This company/app/streaming website is the worst. It just keeps getting worse and worse. Most of the competitor networks apps are better than this one. It's not worth your time."
Dan Thompson,cool
Anaihmonae Smith,Abc yeah
Cecelia B.,9Feb24 Update: Home screen opens quickly now but only the ABC Logo will cast to TV. 24Dec21: Long introductory... You could make a grilled cheese sandwich while waiting for the home screen.
Mark Moultrie,Good good
J N C Davis,"Absolutely, horrible that I have to have a WiFi I'll have to log into when I'm not home to watch my shows I like to watch on other apps... But, since I'm on vacation and at a hotel I can't log into their wifi to use ABC app to watch shows that don't even come into the app until the next day that is utterly ridiculous and should be done differently... Or include cellphone mobile Internet providers on the list..."
Andrea Powell,I have never had success with this app because I thought I would be able to see NFL Games that they cover.
Tiffany Porchiazzo,üíùüíóüíûüíñüíïüíòüíìüå∏I Love ABCüå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏
David Porter,Would give it no stars if I could. You can't watch local channels they make you have to have a cable or satellite provider. Even though it's free over the air if you have a digital antenna. ABC you suck!
Larry David Call,üñêÔ∏è
Kerry Irons,Can I get live stream on my phone cannot get live stream
Tim Floyd,Wish it did not have any ads. Is there a way to have this app add free like YouTube po paramount+ and Disnet+????
Reggie Romain,Does not work for livestream even when signed into TV provider and being in the correct location.
Kathleen Ervin,because I cannot get the ABC app on my TV and it's the only new show I've watched for 40 years
Ann Kennedy,News casts and movies are seen here on ABC very clearly.
david mercado,I need to watch whatever you have to offer. I it served it's everything was good for and very satisfied 100%.
Ron Bremner,"Can't view what is on my local channel, even though I am at home and have GPS enabled"
Bil Cooper,Looks like they finally fixed the long running start up problems on this ABC app. Started up and was running within seconds. Sweet.
Calistea Larson,Very helpful and I appreciate you guys so much.
donna rogalski,Stops abruptly too much!
LAURA HANNAH,Like the app allot. Easy to use on the android app. Slow to load but video and audio are great after that. ü¶ã
Dale Santa,Sucks
Michael Rez,Garbage app! It keeps rotating!!!!
Bernard Burton,No connections
John F,"If you can get ABC over the air using an antenna on your TV, you can't use this app to get live broadcasts. If you are one of the many who pay a TV service provider to provide you with channels you can receive over the air AKA being ripped off, you can use the ABC app to watch ABC live. If I can receive ABC free over the air, why should I pay a provider just so I can watch live on an app when I'm not near my TV?"
Clara James,That's so good. I like using it very much
Jody Green,It works the local channels should be unlocked for the area we live in all over America and we should be able to unlock them without a problem and install local channels on live TV without a problem
Patricia Wortham,Watch TV on my phone and watch the news and weather permitting
Doug Tincher,It's okay I guess
Bonnie Baker,Commercials are much better
Justin Godard,it seems today that all you see is-
MICHAEL MURRY,Get my money back form the government unclaimed property üëß üò§ üòé
Ms. Catherine,"1. Recycled show i dont watch anyways. 2. You got to be hooked up to cable TV to WATCH their shows and, 3. Hiding DISNEY CHANNEL subscription inside this ABC app! Not falling for it. *Conners is the only exception to viewing that but everything else is up to you. Uninstalled it. I'll stick with what I got."
RJ Engle,Why pay for something that's free? I can get all the local channels in my area free OTA. I'm not paying for them. What are you greedy SOBs going to do when the cable/satellite companies crash and burn for good??
maycie loos,Maycie Maycie Brandi
B Ä·¥Ä…¥·¥Ö…™ TX,"You have to have wifi, in order to live stream a game lol. Useless unless you have wifi."
Matt Christy,Only a handful of NFL games and your app doesn't work during them. No wonder nbc and CBS are superior.
Nick Gambella,if it's free with an antenna why tf can't you sign in without a cable provider... should be illegal
ANGELA,ITS AWESOME
Tommy Nguyen,The video player keeps stopping and the app is very buggy. ABC will need better app writers.
MDavid Ben-Yehudah,"Don't watch other than the news or Religious programing and sports, only!"
Robert Hughes,Can not afford app
donald lanthier,"I pay for the Disney bundle, yet it still wants me to have a cable provider to watch content, lame!"
Donna Mcguire,It sucks
Robert Childs,Good
Pkevin ‚ÄúRevkev‚Äù Hobbs,Ok
Carolene Sears,"Yes This is What People Had Only Had.12 Channels Were Good To Bring In The Daily News From Washington D.C ,From The STATE Of Virgina And That Was, Before And Yes How Before Cable SERVICES HAD EVEN CAME INTO SAN.DEIGO,COUNTY, AND YES THAT WAS WHY THE HOUSE WAS FIRST THE CABLE HAD TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE ELECTRIC AND. YES TO THE ONLY PHONE NUMBER WAS KNOW BUILT UP TO BE A VERY CLOSER HOSPITAL THAT YES CALVERT CABINETS HAVE HAD AND STILL HOPE TO BE EVEN BETTER FRIENDS Could ,Always THAT IS GREAT. ."
Scott Campbell,"I'm trying to watch the New Year 2024 coverage, but the app only displays ads and no live content."
Cody Cabo,Great quality is sufficient
Jodi May,This is a SCAM! Y'ALL POST ON Y'ALL APP THAT PEOPLE CAN WATCH Dick Clark show on y'all app ........ When it's actually on HULU! SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!!!! ü§¨ü§¨
The DawgPoundDude,"What is it with NFL and Disney apps? With Paramount+ I can watch football games, but with ABC or ESPN apps I have to sign into a cable service provider for something I can pick up on an antenna? If I could do that, why would I bother with the app? Makes zero sense to me."
Steven K,Stupid that you have to be in the USA to use the app I guess ABC figures Andrcans don't travel or live abroad.
rowdit Dowdit,"Free, a local channel that requires no cable provider wants us to log into our non existent cable provider to watch FREE LOCAL TV! This app is a gluttonous filthpigs joke!"
Samuel Maldonado,Update
Breaking News Live,Update
Valerie ‚ÄúBoo Boo Bear‚Äù Gressett,5 Stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Joshua w,Watch for free? lies
Chris Vanhoose,Garbage app. Keeps locking me out of content in the middle of viewing so I have time sign back in.
Gerald Conners,Sad
Nick Salve,"Useless without a cable sub. I don't understand this. Peacock lets me watch NBC broadcasts. Paramount+ lets me watch CBS broadcasts. Neither ABC, Hulu, or Disney+ let me watch ABC broadcasts without signing in to a cable provider. I don't have cable; I subscribe to services. Why does Spectrum need to get involved in this?"
Christopher Powell,"Not free, false advertising."
Shawn Carey,This app is trash
Bill Green,Typical bias garbage.....
Kenny Lee,This app trash!! Signed in and the shows are locked can't watch without a t.v provider
Tim Davidson,"with spectrum sign in,,works well"
Rosa Rivera-Franco,ABC: Excellent to Watch TV. Shows& Network
Amber Hart,My only issue currently is that the app doesn't allow picture in picture but for a free app with free streaming options it's perfect.
Ruben Torres,They lie
Kat Tini,Why would I need to watch stuff on your app if I had live TV. Needing a TV provider is stupid and severely inconvenient. The fact that you require it is ridiculous! Get with the times. No one uses cable anymore!!!
Kimberly Guffey,Description says you can live stream News and sports but it's not allowing. To watch live sports (Monday night football) it's requiring a sign in with TV provider
Joe Concordia,Why do I need a cable provider for a free channel? ABC is the only channel that won't come in clear with antenna TV. Thanks for making me miss the game! Disney you are the worst!
Debbie Kish,Why wont ABC app work on Roku tv? Ive uninstalled and reinstalled. Still just return ti home screen
Wendy Springhorn,excellent
Dani A Taylor,"Loaded for the first time and all it did was show a red screen with the ABC logo for more than 30 mins - uninstalled after that. If I want it on my device, I don't want to wait forever to see what I can do. Fix your app - PLEASE!"
James Mataras,Cannot rotate screen to go to landscape mode. It just keeps rotating back. No answer from support.
Mike Lyon,It blows. Chromecast streaming is unreliable. Get your s together.
John Mathis,Football!!!
Tammy Mills-Owens,"Its ok,"
Roy Fritz,You must have cable or satellite or a streaming service. To use this app.
Claire Province,Spoiled the finale of the Golden Bachelor for my mom and I while we were watching the episode. Some of us can't watch live and this app sucks. We avoided spoilers and ABC betrayed us. Severely disappointed
Rosie S.,"I prefer watching abc shows on Hulu. Thank heaven I can because it is easier to use I don't have to everytime I use it put in my cable carrier for instance And your app in the past has had glitches Plus what is with the pulsing logo, you used to have a simple abc logo and then it would open. No throbbing no pulsing. Go back to that and get rid of q&a for cable acct. ty"
Frederick Kimble,Great . GL to
johnny morales,The app takes to long to load other than that it's good
Mark Bernoski,I'm screwed as a direct tv customer by the carperbaggers at Tegna so I'm happy I can use this
Pat Abernathy,"Garbage, they make you log into your internet provider-just to advise you can't watch programming with your ISP. Don't waste your time if your trying MNF."
Cynthia Bowie,still exper
Joyce smithson,pitiful
Kim Chambers,I enjoy watching the stars dance
Rick Hargrove,"Round and round we go. App just spins, flashes . If thats what ABC was aiming for they got it. Is ridiculous that a major TV network has such a screwed up app Wonder why the other networks app works and theirs doesnt ? Guess Disney has better things to spend their money on."
B III,"Let me rephrase: this app is terrible; I can't stream live TV and I have Frontier. It's not a developer issue, this is Disney not allowing all markets access to programming based on geography. (Dumb)"
Linda Scribner,Plz cancel
Trudy Allen,Great
Louis Rodriguez,Live streaming never works
Ben Carrier,Says free but then you need a cable provider account login
avis welborn,Overall great! Keep it going !!
Margaret Finney,"I like wheel, Price and all"
Zella Dunn,Was totally surprised how is it was to connect my devices to my account and my provider account.
E-Man Batts,The app won't open
Helen Mulligan,Love The Dr. Incredible pol .
Cindy Donofrio,Couldn't watch live
Nathan Robbins,Why should you need a cable provider to watch a BROADCAST channel!? Don't waste your time downloading this just to find out you need to have a cable subscription. Off to scamazon to order an HD antenna.
Robert Mutenzwa,Streaming features are amazing
S Jordan,I have this app on my Android and my fire TV and those irritating flashing red balls flash and flash taking forever just to load the app and then half the time It just sticks and doesn't load. I have several streaming services and lots of apps and this is probably the worst. I only have it to watch General hospital which is 8 days behind unless you want to pay for it. Yuck
Inge Marie Rosen Menga,Dancing with The Stars
Ray,Absolute garbage app doesn't carry local coverage.
Aaron Nelson,The app literally won't let me watch anything in full screen mode. When I rotate my phone the app switches back to the home tab automatically. If I click on the full screen button in the bottom right corner it still sends me back to the home tab. Uninstall. Never again
Setnakt Spears,"WORST APP EVER! THE POS APP STOPS FOR NO REASON, REFUSES TO KEEP A RECORD OF WHAT STUFF YOU WANT TO WATCH, AND FORGET ABOUT IT KEEPING TRACK OF WHERE YOU WERE IN YOUR SHOW BEFORE THE GARBAGE FAILED! UTTER GARBAGE!!"
Greg Kirkpatrick,It's insidious that ABC frequently requires a login from a cable TV company just to be able to watch their ad-supported shows.
Ken Riley,I love pretty much every show on this network!!!! Nuff said!!!
Debbie Apgar,I used to be able to watch live TV when optimum crapped out in me and now I can watch live TV on ABC ap either....
William Grass,Ill be brutally honest here. Hey you $#!@ heads how many times this week am i going to have to provide my internet/cable provider this week. Also live part seems to crash in evening sometimes. This is why i gave 1 star
Kim Yahnke,you have to sign into a network to use this
Patricia Alexander,I love the way I can watch my soaps on my phone but I hate that it's locked on up-to-date version of the general hospital that you have to pay for it's some kind of way I don't know I don't just crazy. That's it
the PdLs,"Not able to watch live, local programming in certain locations (right now, NewOrleans) even though I subscribe via provider. What good is app if I can only watch next day. All other affiliates (CBS, NBC,etc) allow... why not you?"
the PdLs,Loading is silly. Digital equivalent of jazz hands
Ossorio Steven,Only wanting to watch local news and the world news would not let me watch either unless I had a subscription or paid for it that's great to know that Disney has made my local news so boosey back before streaming services we're the norm YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR LOCAL NEWS STATIONS smh
Adrian V Abbott,Like to watch my programs when I travel
Newyork Giants,"I don't understand why if this network is free over the air I have to pay or be with a provider in order to watch the same content. Strangely enough if you Google this very question it will tell you ""because they can"". That's ridiculous. I only gave one star because it wouldn't let me give less."
B Jacob,Still no option to watch live tv without requiring a subscription providor. Why not have it free with commercials? App is useless unless you have a subscription.
Duve Chomsy,You can't watch Monday night football; it is locked. Don't waste your time. You need to have a subscriptionvto cable provider to watch your free local channels.
Gregory E,"Loaded the ABC app for my wife to catch up on GH. Has to go thru a login process. Then had to verify I had a paid provider, Dish. Then go thru that. If you start a program it doesn't buffer like Netflix does so can't fast forward more than a few minutes. If she doesn't finish a show and goes back later it doesn't allow her to resume the episode, now can she fast forward to where she left off. For a huge media company, one would think they would have all the bugs worked out. Judging by reviews no"
Jeff Lund,Can't log in with YouTube TV subscription because the app doesn't meet googles security requirements.
Michael Torgerson,Download then opened the app to see a movie. I couldnt even get to the movie page to play it before the app said there is an error and to clear the cache.
thea callender,Have to sign in multiple times. Times out unexpectically
Jaden Myers,It free but u need hulu
sandy williams,I get so irritated when some mornings I can stream the view live and then there are mostly every other day you tell me that dish don't support abc streaming. It really pisses me off. I dont have a tv in my room and some mornings I don't feel like going to the livingroom to turn on the TV. This app is very irritating.
Kesha Greene,Don't waste your time or phone space with this app unless you like old ABC shows..its my local TV station they want me to pay for #uninstalled
John Wilkins,If I had a provider like Direct TV I wouldnt need your ignort app to watch the foot ball game now would I?
Bev Martin,Ususlly works pretty good!
Sarah,Good
Cookie Brianna,"It has the show I want but the problem is, I can't find the other seasons like If you are going to have a show on your platform at least have all the seasons and have all the episodes, the show I was looking for I found it but it only have the last season and it only have 5 episodes and then you recomend Hulu. I'm not going to get an app that was for free and then have to download another app and you make me pay that isn't happening."
Michael Watts,Great job
Bonnie L,"This was great until it wasn't!!!!!! Was able to live stream and watch previous show episodes. Now nada. Very frustrating. Feel like all company cares about is $$$. Tech support no help even with error code provided, Give me a break. The app description says watch anywhere on any device, then they have disputes with providers and suddenly ""not available in your location"" Went through the same thing about 3 years ago. üò¨‚òπ"
Deborah Davis,it is so awesome
Vickie Bradburn,Easy to work with.
Marilyn Bouldin,"It wNts me to sign in thru dish, which is longer running channel 9. Ive watch hrs early today, but now it won't let me. Frustrating"
Christine Purves,Does not like to sign on to my Samsung phone
Michael Hitt,"Terrible app, doesn't work, not sure what it does because it doesn't do anything. Downloaded it to watch Monday night football, it's constantly buffering or won't work period."
Bil Cooper,"(10-9-23 update). You need to fix your freaking login problems, such as looping through the verification process over and over until you finally get your deviced verified. Read the forums. Happens on all my devices. You want me to watch ABC, get some devs that know what to do in building and maintaining an app."
Debbie Rodriguez,Can't watch football tonight without signing up with cable. Don't need cable I have a smart TV.
Elsie M Jackson,"Haveproblemd finding shows at times, otherwise good app."
Desarae Mathis,Worst app ever on roku.. I've done all I can do to login to watch an abc Sunday family movie... and it doesn't work. Very angry and just deleted it. Absolutely no point in using the app.
Nicholas Popczun,"Can't stream free, over the air ABC channels. Pretty pointless"
adam campbell,This app should make the public access channel free to watch live. Super ridiculous to require a paid subscription for another streaming / cable company just to watch live on the app.
Trinidad Villalva,"Of all of the apps in all of my devices, your app is the only one that consistently doesn't work properly. I try to watch and it just freezes and goes, freezes and goes. Making it difficult to watch anything. What's the point in having an app if it's not gonna work. I thought that maybe it might just be my TV. But it's not. As I said, it's across all of my devices. I'm on a Samsung tablet and pioneer fireTV. Please tell me how I can fix this if it's something I'm my end."
Bonnie Miller,Technical problems...always with Liberty Cable PR
Cierra Ladwig,"This app desperately needs picture in picture/floating window. So mobile users can watch while doing other things. Otherwise, I can't be bothered to stay in the app. YouTube, twitch, even hulu has floating window."
Michael Maller,"Not free for local TV only Local NEWS. Can not watch shows like ""The View"" live."
Amanda Posey,won't play the show. it gives me an error code. tried everything. poor app

Unacceptable to all your customers üòû@abc support I can watch this free on cable with digital antenna but not logged in through my TV provider that's bogus change the app. What a disservice to everyone
John Lynch,Completely useless. Why do I have to have a TV provider when its broadcast anyway. The providers here have blocked ABC anyway. So I simply don't get to watch ABC.
Mike Cole,Why do I have to pay for broadcast TV.
Jalric V,Useless
Jim Arneson,Sign in sucks - save my info
Yvonne,Clear picture love this app
BeeCee Son,"Awful at best. Slow, can't watch shows. Always Buffering."
jackie hodge,Picture no sound
BJ E,Blurry most of the time when using this app with Chromecast. I'm not sure what the problem is. We have a good Internet speed.
Joan Mendoza,"Used to use the app to watch GMA in the mornings. It stopped working. Fixed after much effort, but stopped working again soon after. Uninstalling."
BH Telehealth,General Hospital

Peggy Terry,Can't use this unless paying for provider
Jared Blazier,Cool better if bought but yeah.
Kim Gray,I am very excited to see that Abc has all my favorite shows
Karen Morris,FIX THIS APP. BUFFERING ALWAYS HARD TO LOGIN.
Linda Marak,The overall experience of the ABC app is foreshadowed by its obnoxiously blinking red logo - DANGER - you're probably going to crash - DANGER - exit and clear your cache - DANGER - this app will auto-reboot in the middle of watching a show... so far the worst of the streaming apps I've seen
Jim B,Could not watch Monday night football.
B Conifer,VERY hard to load. Usually takes 3+ tries
Denelle Allison,Can't watch my show my provider isn't on there not happy
Karen Earlywine,Cant get if you dont have cable provider
Brian Niesen,Pos app. Needs personal data then won't let you watch over the air content without a cable subscription.
Patricia Alexander,Love this app able to watch my soaps on the.
Erin H,"General Hospital is the only TV show I watch. Faithfully, religiously watched it for decades. I love this new channel for 24/7 GH. This show has been on for 60 years, so I'm sure there is no shortage of material. I can't wait to see what you guys do with it. Well done, ABC!"
Penny Cowan-Bale,"Very poor, can't watch the episodes just buffers!!!"
Leroy Copher Jr (Leeis337),I have always been a long time fan.
ILA KASUDIA,Each time giving code to start world news ABC channel.
Marjorie Dieudonne,Disney took our networks off our cable because they are greedy and I am not paying high costs if they keep taking networks we pay for. So Disney is worth billions already so stop bleeding working people of their hard earned üí∞!!!!
aja walker,I can't even watch ABC now due to Disney's disputes with Spectrum my TV provider.
Paul Budlong,"Worst app of all broadcasters, ABC is NOT free to watch on the app fyi"

Cedar Amy,Have to sign into a TV provider for Free Television.
Ellyn Brown,Love abc!!
Jason Cearley,"X is zero by $""7:#kg"
Dan Reriro,"Well I was a little excited. But they haven't included many Spanish channels. And a lot of the 'included' channels are no more than clips. I will enjoy watching Will Trent. Otherwise it's a bit frightening to see what passes as television content these days. In fact if I was these guys I would avoid putting it together in an app. It showcases how awful tv has become, and this, instead of celebrating a network, effectively becomes one big farewell."
Janette Havlicek,I mainly use abc to watch General Hospital when local channel has a news interruption.
Bobbie C,Never works
Saundra Bales,Great place to catch up my stories.
Sandy Loesche,Doesn't always connect on my phone(samsung 22+)
Sam Luongo,great
Michael Muniz,R ever. di. 3d v b 1w 77g7. I7ghh
Jared Wood,Trying to select my TV provider so I can watch live TV and I tap it and nothing happens at all. Very pissed
Donald Woodward,Love it Thanks
James Graves,Why does this want a TV provider. It's 2023 nobody uses cable anymore. Why can't I just pay to use it like anything else. They're going to cram commercials down your throat anyway. These apps are becoming more useless as people get rid of their TV providers. Uninstalled one star totally useless to anybody without some type of cable provider. It should say that before you install it.
W M,"Update 8/23/23 The app STILL SUCKS! BUFFERRING, BUFFERING, BUFFERING! Have to sign back in at least once a week! I do NOT have this issue with any other network apps! Happens on 2 tvs and my phone. ----‚Äê‚Äê---------------------------------------- So disappointing. I use this app on my and 2 tv's. It used to load up fast. Now it takes forever IF it loads at all. Then it freezes. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app which fixes it for a short time then the cycle starts again."
Neil Krauch,"Over the course of the summer months, I've attempted to watch primetime shows I missed during the regular season. I can navigate through the ABC page and get to the show lineups; but each time I select a show and episode for viewing, all that happens is the spinner appears. It never opens the show as the other network apps do and I've just resigned myself to the fact that watching past ABC sows via the app is never going to happen."
Hartley Burt,So slow! This app sucks
Brad Greeff,"Feel like I'm owed money after they got my data by signing in and showing location and then absolutely nothing working. Is this a scam? Update with response to developers: your app is the ""problem"" and this was me ""reaching out."""
Delilah Teague,I absolutely love David ‚ù§Ô∏è and the others. Great news to short Keep up the good work üòòüòòüòòüòò

Ann Medlin,Good.
Margarita Escobar,Can't watch General hospital!!!@
Verdie McCann,Update..2023...much better! Comes on fine and stays on! I keep getting the message that I do not have access a 400-1 error code. My provider for cable is ATT. I used to use this app with no problem. What happened?
Linda Marak,"I am constantly having to restart this app, and I don't know why but it keeps showing the same horrible episode of 20/20 as an autoplay for THREE+ years now"
Gary Lin,Works
Rolaid Brown,"If you want to waste some time, try to link your TV provider by using their given code. They will give you a seven digit code to use, but only 6 character spaces to put it in. Awesomeness!"
Libbie Rascon,"All that keeps looping is a red and black ""ABC"" logo, the app never launches. Deleting the app. :-("
Laura Michols,"Low rating ONLY for the potential seizure inducing start-up of the app, which takes too long to load & shows a bright red screen w ABC logo continuousy flashing from bright red to dark. It's always been this way and often times never loads! So if you reply for me to contact you about it, then you must be implying it does it to my phone only. Make app so it opens quickly for all and not this fast back & forth flashing red to dark screen, which is just horrid! No good reason to do that to people!"
Alison Palmer,Most of the time it's a good experience. Unless I have to reboot over and over to watch something.
BERNICE LANE,Good
Deidre Mercer,"Well, ABC successfully excluded many from watching the Vice Presidents' interview. They announced it all day. Had members of program staff announce it. BUT PLACED IT ON A PLATFORM WITH LIMITED VIEWERSHIP. I think it was intentional!"
Michelle,This app is difficult to log into and it's super slow and always buffering. It starts off with a series of flashing red and navy circles that seems to go on forever. Are they trying to cause people to have seizures or something what's with the flashing screens? You will encounter all sorts of different strange restrictions on what you can and can't see depending on how you've logged in even though all of this used to be free on their site. Then they bombard you with lengthy commercials.
Joshua Celento,"I am a fan of ABC, I just feel the app is difficult to navigate and it needs updating and to be more pleasing and welcoming. I have a difficult time finding the app because it does not stand out. The network and shows are wonderful, just the application and logo needs work."
Tony Pryce,Iko

Ricky Epps,I can't watch daily returns of General Hospital.

Jane Kiceniuk,"Tired of the glitches, today is saying service is unavailable. And bounces between sign in & select provider, green check but nothing.

Mark Constable,Amazing news experience! Thank you ABC.
Reyna Medina,Iam not Homer off the Simpsons no character
meg meyering,I have limited experience to date
Dwayne Barber,Love it üòç
Timothy Evers,Way too many ads. More ads than content. Considering how big abc is you would think they could afford a better experience for their audience but no. I can't watch it. I've never experienced more ads ever and no way to pay to bypass them. This is the worst app I've ever used. Disgusting and presumptuous. I'm only going to leave it in my phone so I can warn others how bad it is. It's more like watching constant commercials with slight interruption by the show itself. Mind numbing.
Sara Guy,GOOD
Rogeco,App takes forever to open up. Typically loses your TV provider and makes you sign in again. Can't make it work half the time. Terrible app.
Paul Larison (applekid),"I can't sign in because I don't have cable, silly maroon. I have a digital antenna but sometimes I can't access my local because of interference. I thought this app would be the solution, but it's not. It assumes you have cable which is a failure on your part. FIX IT. THE ROKU APP IS NO BETTER. STOP YOUR DISCRIMINATION."
Ronda Williams,It freezes up a lot.
Joe Ruth Shelby,"I love the good Dr,"

Jonesha Cobb,App keeps freezing while watching live shows and the quality becomes terrible. If the developers could get to the root of the issue then the app would be great

Cathy Smith,Love the app when I go out of town. I like to watch General Hospital and not have to have a week's worth when I get home. This app works great!
Carrie Johnson,"The app never fully opens, it just flashes the ABC logo over and over."
Stephen Mayfield,Sometimes it takes too long to load up. Then some shows are not available what's up with that?
Martha Cook,I really like the app and I depend on it each week to catch up on the shows and news that I miss.
Matt Martin,Still doing same thing down loaded for 5th time. It's still isn't doing anything. It is just showing abc logo over and over!!! I guess it is not worth my time!
Shavon Helgenberger,Really love to listening song .Every singer are doing good job .They got challenge from God.
Claudia DeBruyn,How come I don't get to watch something? That's actually happening I have to watch old shows from last week???????
Ryan Bet,Made me miss the OT for Vegas
xmarcs,App constantly crashes. Even when it works it takes a couple minutes to actually load past the first screen. Also absolutely not fair that games being broadcasted on ABC are not available through this app. Never paying Disney another cent
Chris Reeves,"When I open the app, it just loops a loading screen"
xoxo dance,Doesn't work. Keeps flashing red and black ABC logos....
Asa Tobias,"Only downloaded it to watch nba games and then told I can't watch in my area with my provider. Every other service channel (fox, tnt, etc) works. Bad business."

Deanna Wert,Easy to use

Jason Grahms,No Star Experience app crashyesssses
Jim Kallas,occasional light buffering
Christine Powers,Still messing up
Elizabeth Jones,"The app does load. Just flashes the ABC logo, but nothing else."
Sean Reynolds,"Nice idea, terrible execution. The few ""unlocked"" channels show random episodes from various seasons, and they repeat them over and over and over. The same goes for the embedded commercials. This app costs nothing and it's worth every penny."
kevin h,Who designed the opening sequence? This can give someone a headache or seizure.
junior lopez,Won't let me in the app
Kelly Ann Rodriguez,"Seems like the crashing during commercials and never able to actually watch a full show without freezing has been an issue for many years. Alll the responses are just to go to the feedback response in the app to report it for more help, but NOTHING HAS BEEN REMEDIED, EVER! SAME ISSUES, DIFFERENT PERSON, DIFFERENT YEAR!!!! Here I am with the same problem, and I tried for this for first time... FIX THE PROBLEM, or REMOVE YOUR USELESS APP!"
Michele Nashe,It's not so good. it takes too long to come on.

lady lady J TV,The app won't open
Rose,"Terrible, I can't watch PAWN STARS SHOW OR STREAM IT LIVE. AFV show, no live stream, and last week isn't there, I just keep the app. To remind me how horrible it is. My cable includes these shows. Have to stay home, watch them on tv."
Ann Payne,I really like the app butvi don't like that episodes getbpulled off too soon for me
Abhinandan Suvarna,Paid one but has good collection
A Alsman,Free TV... I heard this will be a Tubi competition soon.
Aaron H,Worst tv app on here!!
Tricia Solinski,I always have trouble signing in with my TV provider. The ads are a lot of repetition. I know some of you will like this but in 2023 it would be nice to select an ad. (Some ads have select experiences but same product). I think streaming I should say if I'm interested in a product so it can start to taylor ads. I'd be interested in the product or after a few seconds able to skip. Especially if it just is a repeat of an ad from the last ad sequence.
Jan Dre,Doesn't work on my phone
Vanessa Brown,"I am having trouble updating this app. I did updated this app, but it isn't working."
Willene Denney,We always watch it so we love it

ellen moskowitz,I like this app
Ashley Flores,This app keeps blinking red and I can't find the one that I use to have the brown abc logo one and I don't like this red one it don't let me do anything.
Deborah Clark,It takes forever to load and when it does finally load it kicks you out while your in the middle of watching your show. You then have to restart only to get kicked out several more times before you can finish watching your show. Very annoying!
Robin Startzell,App won't open after I installed it
Carmen Ogas,Doesnt work. Just keeps flashing ABC
Edward ‚ÄúPopsto4‚Äù Shields,Great app.
Deanna Hudson,Won't go past abc circle moving
Jerry Robles,In los angeles the local ABC channel is playing the Warriors vs Kings game but if I download the ABC app and try to watch the game I have to have a t.v service provider? Lol make it make sense
Reina,"Almost every time I open the app it asks me for password, provider. Why do I have to do it every week? It's ridiculous. CBS never does it. I contacted the customer service. They told me that they fixed it. It worked for a little while and not working again. I don't recommend it at all."
David Johnson,Why do we need a subscription to a cable company for local programming? ü§î
demery hamil,Terrible
Se Vill,doesnt work with tv provider.
Javal Mcgee,"App doesn't load past the ""ABC"" splash screen. Uninstall/reinstall didnt fix. Multiple people are saying the same thing so no, I won't be emailing your service team. EDIT: looking further into this, ABC has a HUGE latency problem with their app. I honestly can't believe their engineers arent all hands on deck to fix this. It should not take MINUTES for your app to load. No, it's not my wifi, I use brand new Orbi mesh (wifi 6) w/ 2gb symmetrical fiber connection. ABC/Disney is the problem."
Russ Sattler,"The app sucks, freezes can't watch shows for weeks after they air. It seems like they're not even paying attention to their own app"
Jeffrey Pincus,Updated and it wouldn't open. Should get zero stars.
Richard Robling,"Does not load, useless"

Cynthia Daniels,Good

Andrew Smith,"The app takes *forever* to load, and when you finally get it running for a little bit, it will drop the stream and you have start all over again."

Ashley Baumgartner,App takes forever to open

Nestor Lopez,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! This app sucks so bad 100%! A waste of space and its also false advertisement. Said it was showing the Warriors vs Kings last night and instead it would redirect you to documentary. Not today 5/16 says Lakers vs Grizzlies, again redirect me to another show."
Eded Green,Worst app ever don't download it üòû it cost
Dark Gable,Doesn't load
Jonathan Lee,"You can't watch what's being broadcast for free over rabbit ears antennas. You have to enter in a cable TV provider to watch the live stream, which is silly since ABC is free over the air..."

love peac one,I love very interesting
E B,"Just curious as to why your customer support only responds to positive reviews. And if ABC is onwed by Disney, why can't i get local ABC programming? I pay for Disney+. Misleading & Deceptive. Still no way to watch live TV if you don't have a cable provider."

Erika Hernandez,I haven't used this app in awhile so I Uninstall it then installed it again and still does not go past the open screen
Pollo Chkn,Great app
Stacy Corcoran,Ap never actually loaded....just stayed on the loading animation for about 2 minutes before I closed it and uninstalled it.

Tammy,I love ABC!!!
Shirley Gonzalez,Less ads
Michelle Bottorff,It works great. Get to watch shows that ate not on T.V anymore.
Christna Huffman,The app is ok. My major issues are the amount of commercials and the volume of them. Plus the app likes to log me out of my cable provider constantly. But it does have good content to watch.
David,Pretty good thing is most my slow intro Internet speed att
Cheryl Dambrosio,Never works

B.L. Lawrence,"Never loads, don't waste your time. ..............."
Tony Lane,"I would have given a higher rating because rhe app content is great. However, launching the app is frustrating as it tries to connect to the server (takes 3 to 4 minutes to open)"
Floyd Alan Harris,Great app to have to catch up and watch TV when Directv dropped our local news station.
Vicky,"So, if you compare or contrast this app with the NBC app, there is a lot lacking. The My List comes and goes. There always seems to be some kind of problem with it. Then, it doesn't show if you've already watched something. And, then some episodes listed start out with something from 2022 & you have to search through to find something current. In my opinion, this app is really lacking & the developers need help."
Robert Tortorelli,Limited programming
Susan Milliman,Good to watch past episodes of General Hospital i missed
Sonja Mccrary,Hard to find the show I watch even though I have tried to add it to my list in the app . I only watch one show from ABC and it just doesn't keep it on my list . And beyond fed up with it being interrupted by the white house and breaking news. Why can't they interrupt at any other time of day. While a dumb game show is on?!
Nick Georgopoulos,"Doesn't work, just stays on splash screen. Disney obviously wants us to subscribe to their paid service. Over the air TV in most markets also is poor. They refuse to upgrade their antenna keeping reception poor so that you'll be forced to go to a paid service."
joanne sallee,I love the team (working together)
Lisa Rossmiller,Always great!
Steven Zimmerman,Pure garbage. Can't even get the app to open.
cleon lee,Excellent
Eileen Bowne,I can't unlock episodes of General Hospital. When I go to Verizon to enter my user and password it won't let me in. Can you help me with this issue.
Edward Navedo,Good for binge watching shows
James Shipley,"Honestly I don't understand apps like these.. I dropped all cable and Satelite providers in exchange for streaming and Antenna options. I can get ABC, CBS, NBC, CW, etc for free over antenna, BUT to watch them on these apps I have to have already subscribed to a service in which I would be able to get them anyway. I'm sure the apps are just fine but they are useless to me because I don't care to pay over one hundred dollars a month to one of those companies to use them."
Scott Lee,Opening your app with that flashing screen back and forth that goes on forever is going to give people seizures I mean I can feel when almost coming on every time I open your app
Dusty Powell,Had no issues until update now the app will not load. Stuck on the ABC screen. Using Android phone. Already uninstalled it and reinstalled. Still will not move past the loading screen.
Olivia valdez,It takes to long to load up compare to other apps
Mercedes Beard,"Refuses to open, have tried multiple times."
Jason Yeckel,"ABC, FX, & NatGeo apps all made my show list disappear & have replaced it with an ad to build my list. I did, where did it go? I checked to see if my shows were still checked & they are. I even unchecked them then added back to my list but that didnt help. The audio also goes out after almost every commercial. Its either out of sync with video or it gets screechy like a warped tape"
Libby Ashe,"The ABC: Watch Ne... doesn't download or install on my device ,my Samsung A21 galaxy is not connecting or even installing from my Google Play Store Apps I've been trying for the longest time since 3hrs ago this suck. I don't understand why cause I have Dancing with the Stars on my Disney App for my Samsung A21 galaxy cellphone and my Alcatel JOY Tab both not a problem thru my TMOBILE Internet Device so pathetic and disappointing. This app is useless rating it a Zero-."

Rodrigo M,Pure trash
Barb Reinhardt,Stream never loads. Just keeps showing ABC logos.
jared romig,"Yo ABC, trying to watch the oscars via my xfnity login and it will not let me in. Every time I enter in the code that is sent to my device, it keeps saying wrong code. Even tho it is the last code that is sent. Now it's not even sending me a code. Beyond frustrating. If only it was on CBS.. much easier to access. Just saying."
Ben Yun,"Goes into a weird abc animation with their logo and 3 dots, and keeps looping without loading. Very comically bad development"
Stagnate Films,This app sucks. It gives me a link to watch the oscars and then takes me to 20/20 even with my dish login conected.

Andrew Derringer,"Update: Not sure what changed but the app was able to open this morning after a very long time on the splash screen. Will add more stars back if this proves to be a one-off issue. Original: App will not open on Samsung Galaxy 10+ running Android v12 fully updated. Stuck on splash screen. I've uninstalled, cleared data and cache, reinstalled. Still nothing. ESPN, NBA, Disney+.

William Petri,Won't get passed splash screen!!!!

Trey Trey,The app doesn't even open with this new update. Not usable AT ALL
Cheryl The Girl Gunnell,Uninstalled!!! Use to love this app but hadn't used it in a while. Attempted to open it and was prompted to update it (there was no option to use it w/o doing so & my intention told me it would not be good).

Theresa Lamka,"Takes to long for app to open, hard to remove shows from continue to watch section, (shows that auto open I don't watch)."

Chris Zeller,Commercial every 2 minutes that's 2 minutes long. Ridiculous brainless idiots .
Derrick Chinn,"ABC, Im embarrassed for you because of how badly this app sucks. Your company makes far to much money to have this app function so poorly. This makes me question how much your company even cares about quality. Your programming currently is forgetable. I cant think of a single show on your channel besides The Conners which yall seem to actively root against as its impossible to purchase season 1-4 anywhere. Yall used to dominate. Now yall a joke."
Samantha,I have fast Internet but it keeps buffering.
SUZI HIBBARD,Doesn't open!!!

Kristy Behrens,Your favorite shows and movies
Lyn Slaven,wont open whats it good for?
Grant Zollinger,This app needs to be working more frequently when I open it
Christopher Hamilton,Works ok. The problem is that it's impossible to activate a device using the app. Android also only allows you to open up the activation link in the app. So..... No activation from and android phone... Otherwise good
Sharon Sharon,I have to go get for all
Shelley Stiles,üëç Great for when I missed an episode. Other network apps don't always work unfortunately.

Robert Walker,Can't watch the local channel on the go because Verizon doesn't allow it(?) But I can't watch it through the Verizon app because I left the house. So how am I supposed to watch it?
allan tran,Something wrong with the app. It won't open.
Stephen Smith,"Too much in love with their own opening graphics, i.e. last for minutes. Not able to deliver current The View, nor any other show without provider, as is readily promised in site's beginning menu and as advertised to entice ABC's initial site download. Only has few random =\< 10 minute clips of shows from past decade. Truly misleading, time wasting, and overall frustrating. I've got an android w/ current (2/23 os)."
Sandra Rodriguez,I love it that movie. Please let me on my phone. Thanks üôèüèªüôèüèªüëçüèª
Gdvx xv,Fantastic app Please add more tv shows and movies This apphas freeform tv shows Abc and freeform are the same app
chrissandra thompson,It wouldn't do anything but stay on red and black screen showing ABC......Uninstalled app does not work
Peggy Wage,I have had this app for awhile and now will not open. Might want to fix it.
Terry Martinez,ü§îI'm thinking perhaps ABC should try & steal CBS' or NBC's Developer - never have a problem with their APs Why should several of us have to submit a form to get help with what is a shared problem with the AP? Just post the steps to clear this problem. üôÑ
Alan Tan,Good
Ericka Wade,Commercials are so lomg they make watching any show annoying. I only got the app for a couple of shows and now I no longer watch them due to having to bare thru 25-30 mins of commercials. Ridiculous!!
Kinder Lou,Doesn't open
richard maher,"Worthless to Cord cutters , you have to already have cable to watch anything ! Why bother ?"
Kimberly Hopkins,The absolute worst channel. Takes a long time to even load. Then nothing works and hardly anything is unlocked or even there. They only show trailers where shows are supposed to be. Then it locked up my whole Roku and TV so much that it had to be shut completely off.
Kevin Mahoney,"Would not open, I left it for 60 second still nothing. If you can't poach what you need in 60 seconds I'll go to CBS."
Enola Hastiin,Why can't you watch prior seasons of shows? I'd like to watch The Conner's seasons 1 - 4 but ABC only seems to have the most recent season. That makes no since as they're the broadcasting agency. If this capability exists in the app it's so buried that I cannot obviously find it.
Clint Nix,Nurse ratchet it ads
Mary Gray,The app doesn't get passed showing the initial ABC logo. Uninstalled a few times and reinstalled but still doesn't work.
Lori Mooney,Love Big Sky!
D M,Requires a your cable company name

Luz Rosa,Great app.
Brenda Johnson,Nothing is working I updated but nothing is happening
Candace Campbell,App did an update and now it won't even open.
Deby Living,Worked great for awhile and now it takes forever to load...faced with the dumb abc logo forever spinning and flipping as if putting me in a trans..(please change it) Now it won't play my local news and abc 10 national news says something to that fact that its not permitted. There's a padlock icon under abc10.
Andrew Martinez,I like this very much
Michael Smith,"App never fully starts, just forever on the ABC start screen."
Dawn Engle,Disgusting that you cannot access without specific paid services
Sheldon martin,great app
Leah Jackson,An awful lot of ads for an online program.
Jennifer Konkel,"Don't like that u can't stream live award shows or other programming when they air! Don't have cable or a provider, just my android phone! Can't afford it due to medical bills, had major surgery! Just would have been nice to watch Dick Clark Rockin Eve on new years eve instead of the next day, kinda takes the fun out of it! Wish there was a better solution! Just my opinion!üëçüòä"
Freddy,App is too buggy for 2023 and seriously 3 minute adds 4 times in a 20 min show I wish I could give zero stars this is hands down one of the worst streaming apps
Felicia Sharon Yates,Can you please cancel the membership
Christopher Cook,Ok I will be jkkkkkkkkjkk9k\{! zoom red f FF v be
J C,App never opens
Steve Flott,Ok

Adam Penn (Adam N. Penn),App doesn't even load. Just shows the logo animations over and over.
ANGIE Martin,Great!!
Curtis Bamberg,Does not work past the load screen...smh
Mary Lindsey,This app on my TV is horrible. It take and hour and a half to watch a 45 min show because it freezes and I have to keep reloading to get it to go forward. The only reason it gets 3 stars is because I like the shows.
Eileen Jasso,I get to catch up on whenever
Emily ‚ÄúEm‚Äù Thorne,Literally the worst app I've ever used in my entire life. Sorry to anyone who uses this app. So so sorry to you.
Phillip Burkhart,Why should I pay for my local stations on my phone but I can get it free on my TV antenna
CB10,First time installing it shows a loading screen that goes in a loop deleted it right away
Gina Salge,APP won't open! Use to work good.
George Angel Ortiz,Itisgood G

Kristen Roy,My favorite shows are on ABC like Good Doctor and Goldbergs just to name my best shows.
Clara Vines,It want let me watch abc
Mary Watson,Only have good things to say about this app.
Amber B,Won't go past the screen with the flashing ABC. Reply to developers: Never said a thing about it freezing. The app is trash and needs serious work! Who wants to sit for 10 minutes watching the ABC logo flash waiting for the app to NEVER load!? Absolutely NO ONE!!!
Melissa Collins,The app will not open
Reina,"Hard to get into the app every time. Always problems with General hospital. The app needs to be updated, so when you tap on it, it opens up. This is the only app that doesn't open when I tap on it. I never have this problem with any other apps. I had to downgrade to one star. Can't get into the app today at all! It just saying ABC when I tap on it. I thought that Paramount + app was the worst. Now, it seems that this app is. I don't understand why it's not being fixed."
April Graveman,Never opened pffft
Sterling Phoenix,Will not allow me to watch anything for my area unless I have cable (time to uninstall and stop watching anything with ABC affiliated).
Mitchell Thornton,"Poor quality, and constantly buffering. I don't have this issue with any other streaming app, and it's not my internet connection."
Kent Callies,Doesn't work on my phone
Christopher Cormier,It's Disney app so the live sports streaming is garbage. I don't know why I still bother with cable...
Grumpy Grandpa,You cannot use it unless you have a subscription somewhere lol don't waste your time
Brianna Winchester,"UPDATE!!! WHEN SOAP GETS INTERUPTED, WHY IS NOT ON HERE TO WATCH??? HERES A THOUGHT KEEP YOUR ""SPECIAL REPORTS"" TO ALL YOUR SPECIFIC CHANNELS, LIKE FOX NEWS, CNN, ABCNEWS, CNBS, ETC!!! ) Holy commericials!! It's like watching reg Tv with all the commerials!!!

Sarah Cumings,Won't let you watch basic TV shows that you can watch on TV even with provoder info so would not recommend
Nl Fant,Very difficult to get shows to play
MARY Evans REAVES,the best
Cortney Nicole,This ABC app didn't work out for me. Because I have to sign up for a subscription to unlocked the local programming? Well it's not any good! some of them are locked and some don't. So it's not easy for me to use this app by paying and costing the amount with a TV provider that I couldn't afford with.
Ellen Buffa,App does not work
Meritxel Perales,"False advertising, wasn't able to watch what I wanted in a matter of time. Don't waste your time, so disappointed"
Justin Neal,Uh...I am out of town and it will not let me stream my local content. Sorry I do not have a cable package at my AirBNB. Proof positive that ABC does not care about customers.
Kristofer Kalinauskas,I never used the ABC app before
Brad Trembath,Why aren't you on Xbox?
Douglas Lowe,"Terrible, Terrible app. Why do I have to sign in almost once a week just to be able to watch something that should be available on my digital antenna, but isn't? The process to re-sign in isn't streamline and frequently glichty to the point that I frequently nearly throw my phone out the window in frustration. I'm a longtime viewer of ABC but this app makes me think I need to re-evaluate my potentially bad decision in that respect."
Sandy Brower,It sucks won't let me use my password and twice it told me I would get a code sent in my email to reset it and never did.
Teresa Smith,its good
Sean Shawn,Its a great app
Cleophas Nurse,Smooth
Cody Lynch,Waste of time.

Dorothy White,"I think that ABC is a great channel to watch, so far I have not had any problem with watching it & I will recommend it to others to watch."
Sincere Martin,It's made it so easy to watch and catch up on my favorite shows the appear on ABC.
RJ Deters,"Nothing loads or casts. Sits and spins. All of my other streaming apps load and play and cast just fine. Too bad you have some very nice shows that I would really like to watch. Definitely do not recommend this app at all. And ABC don't blame my internet! It is top shelf stuff as are my casting devices. And after reading the reviews, apparently I'm not the only one experiencing this. Too bad very frustrating"
Ronnie Peterson,Describing how ABC is of the world is to see what's on when we see it.
Ikey Pitts,"Seems I have the same problems as most, and the response is to contact customer service. They must not be listening because the problem is in the app design itself. No problems with CBS & NBC networks. With those, I installed app and was up and running. ABC app has delays and annoying requests for additional info. Uninstalled, not worth the bother..."
Shmeka Bennett,Love it's
The Ledgen 27,Great
Lori Dowdy,Great
Alan Durham,"*UPDATE Disney-ABC Customer Care has worked diligently to resolve these issues. If you are experiencing difficulties with the app do not hesitate to contact them. App takes a long time to load. When it finally loads, it takes several attempts to log in to my cable provider even though I have used the app within the previous 24 hours. There are problems with the app stating that there is a problem with parental controls (which I have never set any up) or there is a problem with live streaming."
Jay Gaat,üëç
Robert Young,"Loaded an Unloaded multiple times! Have tried this app off and on for 3 months on Galaxy Note 20. Has never opened, just spins logo for as long as you care to wait... Negative Star Rating."
Karen Morrison,With as much money as ABC has you would think they could make a decent player so people could watch I have to use it to watch GH otherwise I can't watch today's episode that day. It never matches up the sound and video or you have to go out go back in cause you get errors with player this is so awful please fix it! You have like thousands of complaints do something about it!
Timothy Haley,"So I don't like commercials. If I am watching a show that is not live, why do I still have to see commercials?"
207 Ayers (Indigo -n- Kitty),"All of my devices it locks up during loading of the logo and has never once ever run for me on any one of my devices .. and no I'm not going to ""help you"" fix your app.. seriously that's your response?! to ask me to help you fix your junk. Oh and hey here's a self-explanation it's run by Disney! PS I can't get through that stupid app either! And no I'm not jumping through your hoops in order to help you fix your app."
Stephen Klages,Why should I have cable to watch a channel that is free over the air but won't play or connect over the air having the app is stupid and pathetic
Rosa Michael,The app gets stuck on the beginning just red circles saying abc....never opens...so sad...
Susana Murillo,Not able to watch on my phone.
JOSHUA TREVINO,Abc
Jennifer Johnson,Like
Mitch Devivo,"This app is awful, it'll take you three hours to watch an hour-long show. When you pause or rewind something, it randomly goes to the next show and you need to restart it. That's not even the worst part! The app is too dumb to know you've already watched all these parts, and if you attempt to fast-forward to where you left off, it forces you to stop and watch all the commercials over again! Perfect example of how Disney has lost its way, becoming a disaster of a company."
Doug Meyer,Junk on fire Tv. Can't log in.... constantly freezing. Pathetic app design for a large media company.
Emme Logan,Can't watch an episode through it keeps freezing before and after the ads n when I leave n come back it still doesn't work!! Fix the abc app bc it sux!!!!!!!!! WORST APP IVE EVER HAD!!!
Whitney Martin,Drops a video once and a while but otherwise great app to watch shows!
Sean Reeves,Great
Connie Reese,Couldn't log in... couldn't use activate on my Roku. So üò†
linda,The only thing I don't care for is the same commercials over and t. I don't mind commercials but c'mon get some different sponsors.
Chole Kat,This is the best app
Peake Nasrallah,"This app will not run, doesn't matter how many times I delete it and reinstall. Just loads for infinity when you open it, every time. How pathetic that a company like Disney hasn't fixed this by now...."
Aaron Hughes,"App is junk. It will never play anything I want to watch. ""Currrently unavailable"" or it will try to load and it'll just sit and spin. That's pretty much what you need to do with this app!"
D,"Worthless app, even logged in nothing works. Is this run by children or adults?"
Anton Krebs,They can't even get what's on correct. It's your station.
STEVEN,COOL
Donna Becker,Uninstalled. Would not connect.
ADAM - GERALDINE TOWNSEND BYRO,I'm a Disney+ subscriber and would like to know if I can use this app in conjunction with my subscription. This is one of my favorite channels and I'm very surprised you can't get a subscription for it. Geraldine
Sabrina Adams,App keeps freezing up and error in out
Kath,I would leave no star but I got to choose one at Best. Terrible app I haven't tried it on my Android. I can attest to my Android Smart TV that the app is junk it just has a circle that just keeps going around around it's just junk.
Percy Lance Mayes,It was great! There wasn't any buffering. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to see the interview because I had missed the original airing.
Carla Huggins,Am just now downloading haven't watched yet but am looking forward to watching alot of live & On Demand. Thanks Carla H.
Mr.Robert S. MCHENRY,Ok

Peter Iga,I haven't used the app that much but it seems so far so good
Kim Dettrey,Very convenient when you can't catch your favorite shows.
Juli Balot,The Best.!!
marjorie duson,Great experience
Tina M Park,I am very upset because I can not watch my football team play through this app. It's free but you must have a TV provider if I had a TV provider would I need this app. Plus you have every other TV and phone provider but Roku & US Cellular. The ones I have. So I have just Uninstaller your app. Because it's useless to me. I don't think I can even give you a 1 star. Sorry.
BOOK WORM,works Well so far
tyler fluckiger,Good
VL Barkman,"I rarely use this app since it is not ""picture-in-picture"" capable like all my other video content apps are. Too often I am needing to answer a text, or sometimes just play a game on my phone while I'm watching a show. This app is all or nothing."
Walter Schoen,Awesome reliable programming
Mason Wilson,I'm completely done with ABC the constantly let a show :THE VIEW constantly call people roaches and use race BAITING no wonder why yall can't keep up with NBC #BLOCKEDABC
Lily Arp,"All I want is to watch bachelor in paradise. But no! I get stuck in a loop of signing into my provider and then the app not recognizing it and saying to sign in. I already have, ABC! Almost as bad as the Roku app which constantly tells me there's an issue with the parental controls and won't let me watch live TV."
MaryLynn Milazzo,"ABC is (or was) my favorite National TV channel. But their Apps Do Not Claim to do what they say. Its all a ""catch 22."" First, ABC wont even let you sign-up for their app to watch any of their shows on their app unless you are already a paying subscriber for one of their monthly premium TV Plans...huh?? Tell me ABC Why would I even bother to sign-up for your app, if I'm ALREADY WATCHING your ABC Channel with my Paid Subscription ?? The ABC app...worthless."
Talia San Nicolas,üëç
William Fonda,Doesn't download! 11 months later and it still doesn't load! Why is incompetence central to ABC app? You want viewers? FIX it!
Rachel Baughn,"wont open. waited 35 minutes but the loading screen wont change. i have fast internet, plenty of ram and rom. all other apps work fine including netflix, nbc, cbs, prime and paramount. please fix this."
T McG,Glitchy
Tammy McCollister,"This and the website is absolute trash. I'm trying to watch Good Morning America at work, when it says I could of you're asking, and it won't let me. Then they have the nerve to put try Hulu live. I have the regular one and if this is what you and Hulu are doing to get people to subscribe to Hulu live, I'll be cancelling my subscription to Hulu as well."
Bob T,"Stream never loads - all other streaming apps work fine on my device. Fix your app! Reply to dev: It doesn't freeze, it just doesn't load (circle spins forever). I am running an up-to-date device on the latest version of Android. Everything else works, so the issue is in your end. Funny how I can load the same stream on the ESPN app, but it refuses to load on yours..."
Ronda Reed,Get to see live TV whenever I want. Movies with no commercials
Nate Baker,"People at ABC shouldn't have jobs. Years of non working garbage. What a joke for a company. It's unbelievable when you think maybe after a year they would fix their app, but clearly too complicated for them."
Eric B,"Bad from the start, open the app and all you get is a red flashing screen with ABC going in and out.. and from the looks of the other comments you really need to trash this app and start from scratch and try it again...good luck though, This is deleted"
Omri Roberson,Convient app if you don't have antenna on tv you know what I mean!!!
"Carroll E. Gant, JR.",I watch a clip then it ended then another clip started playing until I paused it then closed it. Why did it autostart? I hate that when I just want to see one Clip...
Teresa Worden,I get to watch my soaps when i miss them
Alysse J.,The live stream constantly drops
ric,Its ok if you enjoy the endless ABC logo animation ...because it doesn't do anything else
GABRIEL LAUREL,App won't even open. Just sits on black screen. Tried on 2 different phones.
Renae Stewart,This app opened when I first installed it but now just flashes red dots alternating with abc over & over & over for ? long. Who's got time for that?!
Mark Raught,Just shows the logo flashing around. Never gives any option to do anything.
Ken Lien,I installed this app from Google Playstore. The only thing this app can do is to play the opening graphic animation that goes on forever. I have to force quit and uninstall. Instead I installed the same app from Aptoid. It ran great.
J,Shows not playing
Barbara Cornelius,Worked perfectly. I can watch anywhere when not home in the living room üôÉ
Christine Johnson,"I have to re-download the app almost everytime I want to watch a show. At times, it takes 2-3 downloads before it will finally work. I'm beyond exhausted watching the red ABC logo flash across my TV screen."
Rose Khatib,Okie
Richard Goree,App doesn't open.
THINK GLOBAL ACT LOCAL,okay
Penny Manning,"On my phone the Ads & movies don't freeze. My disappointment is the lack of interesting or truly compelling content. A boring app, depending on what you want to watch. The free stuff is severely limited. Have to sign in to a TV provider in order to watch the Multitude of locked content. A lot of this programming used to be free in the Analog TV days. Now, in my area, due to poor signals, we have to rely on cable companies to view content. Can't afford cable. I'll likely uninstall this ABC app."
Linda Walker,It asks for you to activate your account. I can't do it and I want to uninstall my account
Chandra Powell,So it is an app for the cellphone AND You HAVE to HAVE a TV provider. The most shows are locked. Says you can wait 8days after some are aired.
irv581,"Live stream not available in Puerto Rico, these are the hypocrytal Liberals that are always speaking about how important are minorities for them"
Denise Price,"ABC APP IS NOW TOTALLY USELESS. I AM ON MY HOME WI-FI, AND THE APP WON'T LET ME WATCH BECAUSE I AM IN AN ''UNSUPPORTED AREA''. TIME TO BOYCOTT ABC UNTIL THESE ISSUES ARE FIXED!!!"
Diana Norgaard,Hangs all the time. I'm watching a show via Chromecast and the app hangs. The show doesn't resume from where I left off once I get it working again.
Katarina S.,Very problematic app. I've used it for years and am having a lot of trouble lately trying to watch shows. Keep getting a message that my service doesn't include abc when it absolutely does. I pay a lot for my service and expect it to work. This is supposed to be a convenience but it's instead wasting my time and trying my patience. I'm fed up!
Katie T,You have to pay for a free channel. We had a digital antenna and watched WZZM 13 through ABC everyday. We got a firestick to increase our channels but still want to watch the news in the morning. Without having a paid TV subscription you can no longer watch the channel I can get for free on a digital antenna. I guess we will be switching news broadcast.
Sweetczz,"Casting icon keeps disappearing, closed captioning function gets stuck on off and sometimes vanishes, after the first show casts, the program needs to be rebooted to cast other shows or the ABC logo just spins into oblivion. Lots if bugs. Shutting the application doesn't always fix it and I have to constantly reboot the phone"
Sandy Williams,Your site sucks it shouldn't take 30 freaking minutes to watch a dame show. I dont recommend your streaming channel until it gets better. It's not my internet connection either....
tonie prince,Never used it
Larry Dobson,Not bad
Terri Earl,"This app is terrible, doesn't work at all. Keeps telling me that I'm not in the country or have available internet yet every other app and tv channel works fine."
Beauti_Ryer,Good better then you tube whose entirely slow !!
David Hawkins,This app sucks. Please explain to me why I'm not able to watch without a TV provider? This is very discriminatory to me because I use an antenna for my TV service.
Lorna Salmon,Can get the best program while babysitting and baby use the television
ShadowBanned!,Useless! Couldn't access live stream via OTA through my cable service. Immediate uninstall.
Dale Darling,In the middle of nowhere with no chance of any provider but the cell company means this app is a loser in the biggest way. 8 years later still only able to watch local/live with a cable provider. ABC your still a loser.
Jody Lewis,I truly appreciate u giving me a chance 2get this TV app.üî§ ( network)üëçüòé‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüí•
Simply Wilda,"Ever since the last upgrade app stalls on the opening logo. Haven't been able to watch any shows in over a month. The fact that there are a lot of similar complaints shows this is not an isolated situation, yet the blanket generic statement from Disney is ""contact customer support"" how about you contact your own department and fix the problem?"
randolph Boswell,OKAY üëç
SIIpscrIIn,dogs#*+
William Wadsworth,It's good to watch your shows when you don't have cable.
Jeffre Andow,Thank to get into a classic. Good.
Evelyn Torres,My experience with ABC is amazing. Thank you.
Kelle Fathers,"If you miss an episode of an ABC show (they also have Freeform and Hulu shows), you can watch it in the app the next day--IF you have cable/satellite and sign with your provider. If not, you have to wait an entire EIGHT days...one full week plus an extra day...and they don't really care that they're playing favorites. You don't have cable? Well, gee, it ain't their problem. Unfair as hell, but not their problem..."
Marty Funkhauser,"Doesn't work! Probably no one uses this attempt at an app, and that's why they don't care to fix it."
Vicki Vandeventer,Wonderful
Ed limper,Garbage.
Don Seeya,I can't get past the first screen where it keeps flashing ABC designs. It's been doing this for several minutes. I've closed and opened it several times. I see I'm not the only user with this problem. There is something wrong with this app.
Kaethe Bratton,"Used to catch daily episodes of GH,but the quit having them...?"
Ken Stolz,Good Shows!
Miguel Vega,Trash app
John Snyder,Won't even get past the loading screen. Tried reinstalling and restarting too. Try a different app folks...
Terryosborn Osborn,good
Sheila Anderson,It takes too long to load and freezes on my Firetv. Update: Would give it 0 stars if I could. This the worst app on my TV. Have to log in every time I use it and will lock me out while I'm watching it.
Christian,"( Please allow it on youtube saturday)I give it 5 stars because I know it's a great channel!! Could you please make the ohio state vs Michigan State game free on Saturday November 8, 2022? Hundreds of thousands or even millions of people will tune in for it. Thank you and God bless you all for reading this and hopefully following through with free football Saturday. I cannot afford to add it to my (Charter) Spectrum cable/internet subscription ( Along with millions of other thankful christians)"
Phillip Maker,This app is junk. It never works. Wasted space.
Devon Cummings,I have anc on my cable it goes from internet provider problem to my tv provider problem
Gean H.,Looks like Everything I want to watch is on Hulu .If I wanted to PAY for Hulu .I would have .But I'm looking free TV. ABC was a free TV station once up on a time. :-(
Sharon Fisher,"Doesn't ever open beyond a very visually restless, bouncy, red and black graphic. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND STORAGE SPACE! DOES NOT FUNCTION."
Anthony Smith,Works great.
Caroline D'archangelo,Excellent!
Carlos Barreras,If I have to pay for a provider won't get you communist socialism app idiot
Tamaru A (MVC30),"This app is a pain. I use it to mostly watch the live stream & its the worse. There's days where the live stream is not available for long periods of time. I get this error on my tv scene & phone ""ABC live stream is currently not available through"". Or it says I'm not authorized to watch even though I'm authorized. My biggest issue is that it cuts the live stream off at the wrong time just to show long periods of commercials. Seems like I watch more commercials than I do the actual show/news."
Lisa Hill,Good app. Really like the ABC network.
Teresa Martinez,"unable to watch shows, continually stating that its not available."
Janis Brady,"Good, unless it doesn't work this time."
Bart Boyd,Nothing but black screen and lolgo
Crandall19,2nd worst streaming app.

Carrie A Jacobs,"Horrible app, it never actually opens and just stays in the red and black circle logo"
Michael Richardson,Just shorts of shows or clips. NOT REAL SHOWS
Bode Rasmussen,This is for me
J D,App doesn't even work. Just a abc bubble bouncing around.
John Frazier,all my favorite channels i get to view and enjoy. thanks
Brad Urban,If you can get pass the splash screen you are lucky. It's a bad app.
Tiffany,"Absolute worst! Had I remembered ABC was owned by crooked Disney, I would have NEVER downloaded the app. Most shows the app says ""Stream in Hulu"". So, Disney things people are going to pay even more money for a membership to an app when they can watch it through satellite provider? Hell no. Junk! Uninstalled"
Douglas Bevin,Quick link and annoying ads.
Terrilyn Sowell,This show is very funny üòÖ
veronica Romero,It wont let me watch The Conners for free anymore what happened i use to watch them all the time for free.
Dean Mohr,Suddenly the Chromecast app is unusable. Constantly asking me to sign into my provider but never working right. Not much better on my phone.
Marcus Snipes,Horrible app doesn't even work
Brandon Hanson,"Unusable, screw Disney"
Kim Zachary,"Hardly ever works. Freezes when launches, gets error message, or just gets stuck at the ABC opening."
Mercedes Ferreyra,Never updates throughout the day?
Dylan smith,Have to have tv provider
Tanya Johnson,Absolutely fantastic. Awesome. The greatest.
Jeff Carver,Glitchiest app of all time. Does not interface with casting. App suddenly closes or extremely slow to open. Shows jump around randomly
Katherine Gonsauls,I love the app I've never had any problems with it I can watch all my shows I can fast forward and Rewind if I want and I have absolute freedom I disconnected my cable I'm saving over $200 a month by simply installing this app thank you so much
Ray Tainter,"The app never actually opens, thus making it completely worthless. How does that even happen? Edit 9-14-22 Same cut and paste response as everyone else: ""if you're experiencing problems with the app, we suggest you contact our customer service."" Or, and hear me out, how about I never use your stupid non-working, won't even load up app ever again? Stick THAT up your customer service. 5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE TOLD YOU THE APP IS NOT WORKING. HOW ABOUT YOU ACTUALLY FIX THE THING?!"
Annece Dunn,Awesome
Cezanne Manalo,Excellent
Steven Moritz,The ABC app allows me to watch and stream all my favorite shows/seasons/episoded that have previously aired or are currently playing on ABC. I love how easy and great it is to set up and like favorite shows to my lists
Harry,It wouldn't load only thing I could see over and over again is the abc logo going up down and sideways. This app needs serious work
Nathan Hunter,Pretty cool til they locked all the shows.
Pat Acropolis,Always a good & easy app
Thomas Agee III,Signed in with tv provider and enabled location only to have the football games I want to watch blocked. Makes absolutely zero sense why you black out local teams I just want to watch the teams play in the state I live in. Would make since for non regional teams/sports
Dennis H,"There seems to be a good chance this app takes a long time to get beyond the open screen. Could be several minutes and then followed with a need to sign in with your cable subscriber. This delay is a big disappointment since I also have a cable box that is easier to use than this app. I like being able to watch my local news station except it is no longer available if I leave the area, then some other station is presented for which is in an area outside of my subscriber territory."
Lisabeth Dixon,LisabethDixon Save
Nicole Mestoik,The app will not open.
Joe Nino,"I use ABC app on my SG Tab S7 everywhere I go and it has been working good for me, the only thing that takes a long time to open up in the beginning but after that it work pretty good üëç"
Casey E,"If you fall asleep streaming this app, it will play back the same two episodes and not ever move on from those two episodes."
Nunya,Stays hung on the logo screen.
Jennifer Hill,"App won't open, just stays on the red/black flashing logo screen."
Mary Kate Iati,The app won't even open.
Tiffany Bashore,This app sucks it doesn't even load for me so it was a waste of time installing. And I just installed it wow this was the worst experience with a tv show app
Linnie Hall,The app wouldn't even open
Gayle W,"Latest update ruined the app, it will not open at all, just the 3 red dots constantly trying to load. It worked fine before."
Diana Bock,App refuses to load and you can't stream programs on roku without error codes that tell you to go to the app for help. Not very helpful at all.
Paul Heinke,Good up till a day ago where it became hard to log into
Raymond White,first time using this and all it does is flash the ABC logo
BRYAN BAKER,Doesn't open. Galaxy S21
Julie Hobbs,Not always available. Buffers. Still buffers even with update still awful app. PROGRAMS don't come up
Richard Ramirez,Why wouldn't this app work. I'm trying to watch live TV and this app won't open
Whitney,"The app sucks. It is always closing. Moves slow, freezes. Not even worth free."
Kyle Smith,It literally doesn't even work AT ALL!!!! I downloaded it and all it does is the loading screen on a loop and never actually loads... Its a useless paperweight of an app that I can't even use as a paperweight... Its more useless than I am which is saying something... Garbage.
Sally Larson,App does work
LATISHA CALIXTE,The app is always freezing no matter where u are. I have to watch your news show on hulu to get better quality. Just needs to be better. Seems like basic fixes. So sad for a major network company.
Lorraine Mayer,Good
Mike Muth,Did not work without tv provider.
josh kelley,Fix the auto rotation of the app. It turns way to freaking easy
Shawn Rhinebolt,The live tv isn't working
Joshua Cassidy,"Your app is absolute garbage and so is your news and broadcast range. Pretty much every network in my area can broadcast OTA with out any major issues. However, ABC either doesn't know how to broadcast digital signals properly, or is too cheap to upgrade. Since OTA is free, so should being able to watch local football games that are on the local OTA ABC network. Yet, the app locks it. Garbage. Not only is your garbage news horrible, clearly you want to make everything else trash. KTFO!"
Carolyn Turner,Awful
Nick Busta,"Stream stops and returns to home screen if you try to view full screen, these are basic capabilities that they fail to deliver on."
Brady Cullen,Stuck on the loading screen
Julianna Brown,App keeps crashing on my roku tv.
Jonah Free,Every other network has a streaming option without paying an arm and a leg for cable
Maxwell Anthony Tegen,I really love this streaming app so much for ABC TV 2 WBAY channel News First alert station Storm center 2 weather 24 7 of Green Bay Fox cities Action 2 NEWS for anything ir anywhere else with all updated and specific dates and totally recommended just like WLUK Fox 11 News or Foxnow TV Network 20th century entertainment from the FOX TV Network WLUK channel 11 News of Northeast East Central Wisconsin
Hott Rod Walker,I love the access to the other channels
Scorpio Rivera,"I have noticed the same (""contact abc/feedback"") response to everyone's comments of your app not working/not opening. Let's try something new & original, why don't YOU contact ""abc/feedback"" and let them know that YOUR customers can't even open up your app, much less give any positive reviews on the site, shows or services??"
Emily Scott,I like it.
Susan Teague,"I signed a paper stating that no one can take any of my information, photos messages E.C.T. without my written concent."
Jose Montoya,Don't use the TV show part but Sports and Nat Geo fit my taste perfect and seems to be working well with my TV provider!

Ted Putt,Does not permit live stream of nightly news.
Devontae King,"It's been over a month since using this app. Every time I watch a movie or a tv series, it kept getting bug problems after watching these ridiculous ads at the beginning of each show every time I watched them. ABC please fix this issue so we can watch more of your shows!! Great shows but fix these ridiculous bug problems or your gonna lose viewers!!"
Nathaniel Ellerbe,Love it
Sean Earnest,Locks up the phone and does not work at all!!!! Get your heads out of your butt and fix the damn problem!!!!!!!!!!!!! I tried installing it again and still doesn't work!!!! Won't even let you sign in now!!!! FIX IT or I'll quit watching ABC all together!!!!!!!!!! Still doesn't work on the app. Black screen with nothing!!!! Problems still not fixed!!! Still won't work! Should NEVER have to log into watch programming that is supposed to be free to watch!!!! You suck!!!!! Dont work!!!!!
Michelle,This is a useless app with the worst commercials. Now they show a disgusting monkey pox ad so I uninstalled their app. YouTube has news and cleaner apps such as AOL. Disgusting ABC network.
Bojangles,Pretty disappointing app for a major network in the cord cutting era. Back to the NBC app I go
Randell Freeman,Love it
Chris Craven,Easy to use
Linda Lewis,The app is no good you can use the app it tell you to update and you never can it's a waste.

Jamie Goffin,I can hardly get on this app after downloading!
Johnnyomd,I can't watch what I want to watch without live tv provider
Diana Frederick,"For the past 2 weeks, app doesn't open, just keeps playing the logo until I give up and close the app."
"Kevin Foor, Jr.","I've always enjoyed watching ABC. My favorites are there: America's Funniest Home Videos (RIP Bob Saget), BattleBots, Beyond The Tank, Modern Family, Black-ish, Celebrity Family Feud, Dr. Ken, F Is For Family, and The Goldbergs (just to name a few). Edit: I rated 3 stars earlier (because of being randomly kicked off watching episodes on the app on Roku TV), but I'm changing it to 5 stars now. Awesome, right? Works perfect on my Chromebook. My bad, it must of been the wi-fi connection... Great!"
Helen Marie,Keep freezing & buffering. Restarts what I've been watching. Very annoyi g
valerie calhoun,"I just want to watch abc & I don't have a provider, besides I hate technology üò°ü§¨"
Long One,Picture quality it so bad that it is not worth my time to view it. Like the latest Generation Gap TV show season 1 episode 3. Too much perverted content even in the commercials.
Bouch Tnt,App refuses to load.
Barbara LaRur,It's very glitches and often freezes up. My ability to get into lve TV is poor compared to other networks.
A Google user,Way too many ads.. its ridiculous
Omar Hernandez,The app is not working at all
Mike VanPutten,I can get an antenna to get local stations for free but I gotta have a service provider to get live TV access on their app... BS
Art's Fun Channel,9 1/2 minutes of ads for re-run program of 42 minutes. Total = 51.5 minutes minimum. Sometimes the program will have a problem and then another 3 minute advertising slot. There's a special place in hell for these people. May the Lord God bless their black little hearts . PS. : TUBI is an excellent free streaming video app. Very few ads and much better adjustable settings. UNINSTALL
Sadie,Clear

Keeps telling me live is currently unavailable when I try a locked show and when I try to go sign into to TV provider nothing shows up. Please help."
Min. Douglas Daniels,Great@
Heather Smith,"way too many advertisements, 2 is enough every 20 to 40 minutes. I know I'm not da only one who thinks and feels the same away about this problem."
kathy bown,The app is constantly freezing. Lately video freezing on the opening page of a show as audio continues. Been this way for yrs. --- I wish ABC would fix it!!
jordan young,Nah!!!!
James Alexander,Very hard app to use anything you watch they want you to pay for not very customer friendly
Rachel Hairston,UPDATE: So you're telling me to go to ABC feedback for help but it is actually no help at all. I need to know how the ABC app can tell me my carrier login is incorrect when it is right?! What Happened?!?!?!?!?! Update was done on July 1st. Now when trying to log using my cable provider its telling me my login is incorrect and if I try again I will be locked out. Not sure what that's about and how they can tell me my login is incorrect and I can log into my provider site with no problem.

Jan Burchard,No live events
Kathleen Daly,I like watching news and the View on my tablet
Michael Nolan,"I recently switched to streaming tv. Google is my network; Verizon is my provider. I cannot access ABCtv because Google is NOT recognized as a network in the ""connect to network"" in the ABC app. Surely ABC is aware of Google, yes???"
S R,"Six(6) !! ads at every commercial break. Tedious to watch. Keep 2 (or 3) tablets going in parallel, and watch only when there are programs."
Brenda Teegarden,Why doesn't the app ever launch! It just loads with the ABC red circle in and out. Never has it ever gone pass this! Freaking fix it!
Stacey Williams,Not all cracked up what I thought you got to have providers it don't really show much
Waco Tx2,Ok
Arianna Wise,Terrible. Cannot even log in with provider. Will be unistalling. A free app not even worth it as it doesn't let me log in.
Sydney Australia,Worthless
Rachel Consoli,I think its stupid to have to enter a ton of information for what provider I use now. It used to just see it and accept it. Now I can't watch anything without going through this process.
sue digiacomo,Won't load
Sharon Palonis,I did find it hard.
Rob Davis,"Won't show video on my phone or chrome book. Says to go to ""help"" which is not visible. Always seem to have issues with this app. Wouldn't need to even watch it here if abc programing didn't screw up my dvr recording. Recorded the rerun yesterday but not the new episode today."

Yung Capital,I'm not happy
Otieno Owino,What is wrong with you people? How can spend 23 out 24 hours a day trying to stream on the app and website and all I keep getting site unreachable? When is it reachable? When are your servers working?

Tshegofatso Francis,keeps telling me about mirroring when I haven't and it's irritating... I have to keep on canceling and starting all over again after 2 mins and I am thinking of deleting showmax
Paballo Maluleke,"Too slow to load not all functions or features appear like the previous version,it takes time to play"
Claudia Naris,Not as easy to navigate as the first app. For instance when you're done watching something or don't find it interesting you can't remove it from the continue watching list. I also don't know where they dug up that old horrible dinosaur movie. Tubi has better movies and it's free.
olu joseph,adding champion league and any other league could have make it more fun
Nayomi Ngugi,It hangs everytime
Ofentse Choma,great üëç

Thaytow Mokhethi,it hasn't been the greatest because of its poor performance.
Sanda Babagana Abbas,"I have had a terrible experience with showmax. The appropriate word to call you guys is "" fraud."" I subscribed to you last month, but I can't watch a movie. It always shows ""showmax isn't supported in my region"" while I'm still in Nigeria. I deleted the app because of this technical failure, yet you guys still debit my account for your monthly subscription. What have i watched in my first subscription? Please refund my money or work on my account, or I will tarnish your image online."
chantel changela,love it

Sakhumzi Plaatjie,"They should give us the old version shame, this is a useless app"
Nic K,"Used to feel I could recommend the app. Now not anymore. Was watching the Halo series. I got to episode 5 and it's just static noise over the whole episode. Emailed them over a week ago and no reply by a human and problem persists Also, why can't you remove shows from the ""continue watching"" section on the new Showmax app? Additional problem, after minimising the app halfway through an episode it will sometimes not save where you left off."
Yaone Goemang,Very bad..it's keeps on closing.. while watching
Mathapelo Mokotso,"Bad experience ever, everytime I press play, it keeps on saying showmax has stopped, open again, i hate this new showmax, that time I pay every month for Nothing, it doesn't even deserve a starüöÆüöÆ"

Emile Shadi,"I have no words, not only did your organisation remove the champions league and europa league, you've removed the premier league for those who view on smart TV's, I don't know how you made me pay for the premium package, but all I know is that you have robbed us of our money and please don't try to cheer me up I just want the old showmax back"

Glory Gloria,"I would recommend to add new TV shows every month and decide whether to keep them at the end or to cancel them depending on the reviews take an example of adding one kid show like demon slayer (all seasons)in all countries,one month and interchange to an adult show in another consecutively and think it will boost the ratings sky high"

I've paid for this subscription which I am not able to use. Either fix this issue or refund me!"
Leendy Thandy,"I am angry I can't download anything. the app keeps on saying I have reached the limit but there's nothing in my downloads. I have signed out, clear catch and deleted all data as instructed by the Agent for the third time but still I can't download the issue is unresolved üò£"

Ntshese Magome,I sometimes don't know what to watch because there are many options. However the previous version/layout was better to manage. Because it was easier to browse through episodes unlike having to scroll continuously.

Mukundi Tevin,low quality
Omatla Setiba,very useful
sam Msuya,waooo
Joshua Muga,"freezes, restarts shows, times out at any opportunity. Garbage app you can do better guys."
Nombuso Malefo,"Terrible viewer experience. It's hard to search for new shows, it's not easy to manouver through shows. The suggested shows should pop up as trailers and allow the user to choose rather than play automatically because there is no option to remove the show. We have to find the last episode of the very last season and run it till the end to remove an annoying show from our list of shows to continue watching. This is unacceptable, i can't imagine that the app was tested from a viewer's perspective."
Marea,This new app is terrible to the core!...the old app was just perfect there was no need to introduce a new app.
Edilson Mugunhe,good
Gerald Kuliti,the best movie stream this year

Otherwise the other things are great. Plz you should fix this issue otherwise I guess $15 waste.
Jonathan Thomson,Watch any kind of movie üé¨ there is
Darick Rudig,I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling it for it to work every day.
stormy piper,Hard took to long
Nick Ramos,You would think by now this app would have a clear all section for things you want to watch without having to restart everything episode one by one. Completely annoying and takes away from a good rewatch experience.
Ebony Ratcliff,not enough movies
Erin,Terrible glitchy app! Not worth a dime.
Shelly Boggs,love it
Tonita Little Raven Weasel Bear,Max has good movies I love too watch.
Michael Patrick,love the wide variety
Noah Fazenbaker,"Disappointing Rebrand with Limited Features! Max app falls short compared to excellent content you can access. The old HBO Max app had more features. Edited (April 2024) Content 10/10 Functionality 3/10 STILL NO shuffle, audio de-syce when skipping intros, NO quickbar for navigating watchlist or any other category. If I could guess, the development team wasn't given nearly enough time."
Daniel Metz,"Audio is so low that it's impossible to watch anything, even on max volume. No other streaming apps have this problem"
Armando Delgado,Satisfied
Jeffrey Smith,later still evaluating.
wITCHo,One of the best
Cristian Cuadra,"I just subscribed, really? ads? I don't want to pay and see ads"
yenny caro hortua,Great programs!!
David Coronel,"incredibly smooth and responsible, I can only wish for more original sci-fi series being added to the catalog."
John Wall,"This app sucks, I'd have an easier time watching a stream on YouTube using dial-up and Windows 98. Stream quality on this app regardless of signal/WiFi is god awful."
Lisa Pearson,I really enjoy HBO Max and as long as it stays budget friendly I will keep it. Thanks for all the great shows and an affordable price üíó
Claudia Servin,Love the movies playing in HBO Max they are very up to date.

GHOST HUNTER,üì±& Tv Black screens! the app is super slow and laggy ASF. Notes a Major down fall On Max App on Roku TV problem Is where I have left off on TV shows seasonal and movies from my playlist & continue list keeps Deleting itself for some reason I shouldn't have to write ‚úçÔ∏è where I am left off of ü§î There should be a save menu in the cloud. Because this is becoming a huge problem even Restarting the app and TV isn't working Please fix.. I pay enough as it is I don't wanna have to delete this app.

Gary,-1 star for not supporting webos 3.5 and lower.
Tina Christman,easy to download movies!!!
Holly Bastin,"It's alright- basically functional, but does give some error messages. The most frustrating thing so far has been when I hit the rewind 10s & it goes back 20 minutes to the same spot in the video, over & over. Update - April 2024 This app is consistently buggy - it's never worked as well as the HBO app. Currently casting a show on my TV that I was in the middle of watching & it started at the beginning. When trying to fix it, it made my phone flip out, I've restarted my phone twice now üòî"
Theodore Thomas,Working a lot better now thanks Max üòÅüòÅ
Wade wade,Limited pic on app
Travis Rector,"Audio in this app is horrible. It'll start almost like it's muted and gradually get louder until it reaches normal volume, until an ad starts. then it'll reach like 2x or 3x louder than the show. I have to mute the TV during ads and then unmute when the show comes back, only for it to start the muted audio-normal audio cycle all over again. This is specific to the Google TV (TCL brand in my case) because the PS5 version works perfectly normal. Please fix this"
Paul Miller,great way to watch John Oliver! ;-)
Kaykan Francis,fabulous
Brandon,it's a great deal
Sassy Devil,"Good content, but not as good as others. Still, a lot of enjoyable stuff. I haven't had any problems with the app itself."
Mateo S√°nchez,Best streaming service.
Name Namee,"why make us download a whole other app .for it to work THIS TERRIBLY. Not only the mini player is a mess, but I'm trying to watch SATC and all episodes are out of order and mismatched. A truly terrible service, it's the last month I'm subscribed to this bs"
JOSE MIGUEL Reyes,excelente
M Morrow,app is the glitchiest of all of my streaming services

Jordan Ghostwalker,"Stream ao vivo √© um dos piores que eu ja vi na minha vida. N√£o fica 1 minuto sem carregar, eu vejo jogos com atraso e picado. Sem chance de eu continuar assinando isso se n√£o for arrumado dentro de pelo menos 1 m√™s."
Gael,"Quando trocou pra max, o app ficou horr√≠vel na televis√£o. Trava de 5 em 5 segundos"
Jo√£o Leonardo Teodoro,"Depois dessa mudan√ßa a qualidade ficou horr√≠vel, chula. Como pode uma empresa com tanto dinheiro nesse n√≠vel, fazer um aplicativo desse?, se √© que pode ser chamado de aplicativo, isso est√° mais para uma tentativa do que pra algo concreto, que funcione."
Antoinette Conde,super cool!
Armando Luna,"Ever since Max became the owner of HBO Max I don't know if they change owners, however they did change the picture quality instead of paying for certain price for everything now you're getting charged for SD HD HDR and 4K. HBO Max used to be one of the top leading streaming platforms over Prime, Netflix, Paramount, Stars and Disney. I have basically all of the platforms however the least platform that is not fair is Max that's what I'm reading a one-star I wish I didn't even read it."
Floren De Waard,can not enter pin # on my tv
Danny Lam,Not a bad app
V,the user interface needs massive improvements
Gabby Serrano,It's always going slow and even sometimes kicks me out. Tbh there's really not that many good movies and the only reason I have the subscription is for house of the dragon and for doctor who.
Aaron Skenandore,F off with the ads. Advertisements are constant. It's ridiculous. Not renewing
Yolanda H.,"I love that it doesn't kick you out after inactivity, all my favorites in one place like true crime, cooking, and renovations."
Tom Beaudry,"Every time I click on a movie or show, it only shows Mythbusters-10 stars for ripping off my money!!!!!!"
Audrey Rodriguez,great app
Arooj Ilyas,Great
Tim L,"Volume is too quiet. Tech support suggestions didn't help. I adjusted settings, still quiet. Next suggestion was to upgrade to High Quality picture & sound subscription. I shouldn't have to pay more money for louder volume, no other steaming service charges extra for louder volume! That's MESSED up!!! >:-( Not enough content to watch, I will be canceling my subscription when I finish watching what I want to see. I lowered my rating after the tech support reply help was unsuccessful, & a joke."
Rosita Landa,Great service
Joaqxdldld,"Because nice, because is hason, because is incredible"
Kevin Seymour,"When it works, it is great. Unfortunately I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and reconnect to my provider just about every time to get it to stream."
Velma Powell,Great
Megan Zendejas,The screen goes black everytime I try to watch one of the shows. It's just the one show though. For some reason it won't load anything on that show .
Carolyn Hayes,Take off. My email address please I don't think I go to you
american joe,something went rwrong again
Paul Hedges,Impossible to unsubsribe from. Don't recommend.
Dillon Six,Absolutely lovely add it to the battle field
Mark Anthony,Buffers way more than Netflix it took me a hour and fifteen minutes to watch a 42 min show. Yes after I did all the little things you said to do and it didn't help. Netflix doesn't buffer at all I'm just saying.
Niko Afuhaamango,probably my most used streaming app on my TV and phone
Joseph Taylor,u coulda stayed HBOMax
Blake Smith,Been using the app for years(have my subscription through AT&T) no issues with the app and love the movies they add on!
Krystal,I've never had issues streaming.
ChillMercury 840,"I used to love it. I don't anymore. It can never take me back to where I left off. It goes back 3 or 4 episodes. And on the TV, it leaves the status on the TV I can never get rid of it."
Dub Jr.,"This app is awesome! It has a lot of great stuff to watch. When it's not football season, I love watching HBO shows, good movies, and Discovery Channel shows. I'm not really into basketball, but it's cool that they have it on there too."
Fernando Yanes,not bad
Terry Scruton,"Can the developers please explain what exactly is the point of having a download feature if the app won't even open when you're not connected to WiFi. The who idea of downloading is to be able to watch movies on a plane or something where Internet access isn't available. Tried it today and the app wouldn't even open and kept saying I wasn't connected which, again, is the whole freaking point."
Guero Wilson,the best place to watch movies I get it for free
Susan Stockman,"All prompts, 2, get 2. Your solution ends at a dead end . Takes you in circles. Frustrating!"
G VDV,"Rollercoaster, right now all is working well. At times there are just gobs of issues, but the content is always great. The UX is great right now, but at times it has been very buggy."
Melba Duarte,awesome
Matteo Tablet,I love this app
saige rodriguez,I love it
Lance Brown,"Worked ok until yesterday, now it freezes my phone every time I try to watch. Then stays frozen until the phone crashes completely and resets itself"
Dillon Perry,"The app made it very easy to leave this review without leaving the HBO app :) I've never seen that before, but that's just the kind of support for my laziness that a streaming app needs :) Also it was kinda special watching a Priceline ad with the same actress that plays Penny while I'm watching Big Bang Theory"
Blanca Mena,Very Good!!!!
Jesse Gallegos,it is great I really like that I can watch stuff while offline
Esperanza Urias,Don't like that the play sigh stared to apear on the screan and stayes there
Alex Vargas,Widescreen ?? Ok I realized what's going on with the pixel 8 pro on High resolution 1008 x 2244 the playback screen is at 85% and when the resolution is set to Full resolution 1344 x 2992 the screen is at 60% playback viewing don't know why ?? If Netflix can get it right why can't Max ??
Shel G,"I have used the various apps for hbo for years, this is the worst. Crashes almost every time on every platform; roku, phone, computer. For MONTHS. WTH?!"

Por favor espero que puedan arreglar este inconveniente ya que me arruina la experiencia."
MJ Smith,the absolute best streaming service!!
Pavel Cabral,ta rechido
Kil XI,good new movies with good old ones...
Hope Harmer,"This is perhaps the worst streaming app out there. The content is fine, the app is horrible. It constantly freezes on my firestick so I end up casting from my phone. There is no skip recap or intro options or next up to skip credits on the mobile app. When I go to start the next episode myself, it's always goes back to home, then I have to search & then select next episode. It's reminded me why I canceled my service before. The app needs major improvements. I'll be canceling after my month is up"
JT,"Ever since this changed to MAX, it sucks! The app on Android is broke, and on Roku it's garbage! Do better please."
Logan Allen,I was going to leave a zero star rating but it wouldn't let me im trying to resubsrib but it won't let me max is a joke

Mary Mcclennon,lots to watch
Barbara Balaban,great
Tm Mc,good app for tv
Sapphira Wolf (Saiya),I love how you can change the audio language but I wish more shows were in Polish. Everything works really well!!! I love the movie selection as well as shows!!
Alfredo Gomez,Great content but can't currently watch it. It asks me to log in again every the I try to watch sometime. After logging in it takes me to the home screen and the cycle starts again.
B. Murphy,"I'd rate this higher if HBO had kept HBO series on the HBO app for me to watch on HBO. The app works well, but the selection changes too rapidly, and constantly has a lack of things I want to watch and re-watch."
Tomer Schwartz,app crush in commercials
Tessa Whitley-Dalton,I love max ‚ô•Ô∏è
A.D. Justice,I have a great selection of movies to choose from on this app!
Kim Bell,"Works great mostly. Just a few things to adjust. Being able to sort and filter My List would help a lot. With so much content, it'd be helpful to see just TV shows or Movies & sort by A-Z or date. Autoplay is great, but there are some shows where it goes to the next episode too soon. Especially the Discovery channel shows, there's still people talking and wrapping up the episode and it will cut off and go to the next episode too soon. Need better Quality Control on when it goes to the next ep."
Elio C√©sar,better scroll down interface and categories..
Mike Michaelson,"Well there's John Oliver, need I say more?"
Ron Wess MusaQ,Awesomeness
Nathan Guerra,"Definitely huge downgrade from GCN app for anything cycling. Can it find race, library is a mess, and replay takes days?!?!?! Canceled and REFUND!"
Lesly D√≠az,Love it
patrica Johnson,Love This App!
Adam Sanchez,Great stuff.
Thairine Abreu,"Invi√°vel assistir qualquer coisa, app trava toda hora, carregando a todo momento. Minha internet √© excelente, o √∫nico aplicativo que tenho problema √© esse. Conte√∫do da plataforma √© √≥timo, pena n√£o poder assistir na minha TV LG. Precisam melhorar se quiserem manter seus clientes. J√° entrei em contato com o suporte e fiz todos os procedimentos. Nada resolve, aguardo o contato do setor especializado"
Isabelle Bittencourt,"Trava o app na tv, √© p√©ssimo de adiantar ou voltar os v√≠deos. O app da hbo era muito melhor."
Ariel Weaver,really good just needs a few more comedy movies
Jefferson Camargo,Horr√≠vel. S√≥ fica travando. YouTube n√£o trava. Star plus n√£o trava. Disney plus n√£o trava. Brasil Paralelo n√£o trava. S√≥ a dita HBOmax trava. Shame on you. E n√£o venham me dizer pra eu desinstalar e reinstalar. J√° fiz isso. E n√£o me encaminhem pra nenhum link com textos que n√£o servem pra nada. O problema est√° no servi√ßo de voc√™s n√£o na minha tv ou na minha conex√£o de internet. Todos os outros funcionam normalmente. S√≥ HBO Max que trava. Depois dizem que v√£o resolver e s√≥ d√£o desculpas.
Emilia Robledo,good
Gregory Hislop,"i am absolutely loving this streaming app morreee than anythingggg!!! And i just also really, reallyyy wanted to just add that it's very genuinely just succhhh an amazingly, tremendously, fantastically extraordinarly marvelous app!!!! ü•∫ü•∫<3333üíñüíõüíúüíñüíúüíïüíûüíòüíåü©∑ü©µüíóüíìüíù‚ù§Ô∏èü©∑"
Alfonso Perfferle,"Awesome channel, one of my favorite ever!"
Joshua Evans,really good stuff
Patrick Burch,really good service. would recommend adding more to certain series'. adding maybe series' movies that was made so fans of the series' could enjoy the movies. or tv shows for the fans of the movies. just for collections sake. tokyo vice was 5 stars tho. the max shows hit hard for sure.
Enrique Zapata,Max is a subscription app. You will be able to enjoy a lot of movies that belongs to the Max catalog and also with Hbo movie catalog. However not the entire movie or series are available. But still you can spend countless hours watching good entertainment. 4 Stars because Max keeps removing some movie titles that should be available.
Raquita Hebert,great entertainment year around
killa flip,has a profile safe for kids to use Love HBO Max better than Netflix
Noel Edwardo Hernandez Minaya,Very good
Levi Maea,just watched dune 2021
Alexander Woodard,Yeah like it

Adrian Rangel,the ads are a bit to long
Jake Strain,it's good
Stefan G,more selection of TV
Tracy Ehler,ehlerfamily

Luis Adriel,I have issues with playing shows movies only for my phone too turn off in a period of time and I have been waiting for a new episodes too appear on my recommended only too always say coming soon this is probably the worst app for streaming I ever used Stay away from this app I'm not even kidding
Drew Caldwell,haven't used app enough to give it five stars but works great so far!
nariah1981,"Love content hate app. It plays the last five minutes of episodes only, even when I finish the series and want to start over. I clear cache restart uninstall reinstall nothing works. It freezes after every commercial and gets stuck. It glitches a lot is annoying."
Amber Pawlak,great selection
Audrey Gillis,Easy to access movies see what's coming next

Ryan McGinnis,"could use improvement on the navigation of the app, but otherwise it's good"
Jorge Sarrouf,"Terrible, hbo max era mala y est√° es peor. Se traba, te ponen trailers, se cambian los subtitulos y audio de idioma, la reproducci√≥n se entrecorta. Probablemente la de baja"
Pamela Gallaspie,The app doesn't tell you have to pay maybe 3free passe my it myself shows how rcunerful movies at the top of my hand
Josh Steinberg,"Max has the best content of amy streaming app. Unfortunately, you can never watch any of it because the damn app is always buffering."
Myriam Mart√≠nez,"Qu√© porquer√≠a de actualizaci√≥n, si pudiera ponerme 0 estrellas lo har√≠a, c√≥mo es posible que le hayan puesto anuncios?, lo √∫ltimo que quisiera es PAGAR una plataforma de streaming con ANUNCIOS. Para colmo suben el precio del plan que incluye exactamente lo mismo, pero sin anuncios, qu√© estupidez"
Eric Bishop,"I've seen improvements, logging in is much easier. Good selection."
Matt,a lot of woke content
Son Hebert,"I like hbo max the only complaint I have is that when you download a movie, your time limit after watching it is cut short. so when I'm gone for weeks at a time with no data or internet service it sucks"
Maria cambray,I love Max.
Chloey Fackrell,it's pretty good I wish it had the lorax and the cat in the hat. But other than that it's fun to watch the amazing world of gumball on it.
King Venia,great just wish there were more things to watch
Susan Charles,Don't miss this app!! Download it now!!!!
Jovanny Gonzalez,"This is so good , it has so many movies and it also gets new movies at a good time I love it but I wish it had the movie IT but it doesn't really really matter Max is very good for people who like new movies coming out not too early but not to late,this also lets you download movies on your phone, tablet etc. you can watch movies that you downloaded when you don't have any wi-fi or signal ,Max is awsome"
Jeremy Ortega,very good app

De'Aundra McKinney,Love this app
Making Changes,you can go wrong
Charles,"Make is so I can rewatch an episode without having to go out of my way to rewind the episode then fix the minimizing screen option, it hardly works properly and my whole screen goes blank gray if it's minimized and I get a commercial."
dwayne west,great movies and I love being able to watch the basketball games. just wish there's more of them on here available to watch. but overall I'm more than satisfied. thank you
Beverly Mcgrew,I just love it you can get anything on there

Phil G,"love max. great programing. don't even mind the commercials, except they are always played at an extreme volume. would give 5 stars if it wasn't for that."
Uriel Fuentes,I can't cancel!
Elijah Champlin,"This streaming platform is very unstable for how much it costs. It's more expensive than most and freezes constantly to the point where shows and movies are unwatchable. Fix your service that you're overcharging for, you lazy, greedy, and unproductive ""company."" The video games warner bros has been putting out are just as bad. But people eat it up because it's ""popular"" when, in reality, it's an unfinished dumpster fire that a woke company is using to push its agenda."
Sunny Garcia,great selection of many great shows and movies.
Courtney Frost,some of the best movies & tv shows old and new
Nicole Navarrete,amazing
A Google user,Great
D C,Please put a Moto GP tab so you don't have to search it every single time. This is nearly the only thing I watch on your channel.
Megan Freeman,"I really love Max, especially now that it has TLC and its subsidiaries. However, I am a bit disappointed that they don't have every episode of sister wives. There are other shows I would like to watch as well that were from the early 2000's etc. But we wanted to rewatch sister wives and get my spouse caught up but then noticed not every episode is on there. More than anything we wanted to see ""The Tale of Two Maddie's"" episode again cause it was so cute! Please put every episode of shows!"
Abbie Harlow,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP MAKING EVERYTHING AN APP! I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DOWNLOAD AN APP ON MY PHONE TO SIGN INTO AN APP ON MY TV TO AN ACCOUNT I ALREADY HAVE WTAF
Sara Lawrence,"Basically, I can't stream at night. It'll work all day, night time hits, constantly pausing and buffering every 1 to 2 minutes."
Ismael R,"I can't change the subtitles front and opacity, settings nowhere to be found"
Nate Colcord,the Name HBO is just better. MAX=-1Star
Humberto Valenzuela,"The options for download are not very intuitive, as well as how to fast forward or rewind. The search for sports content is awful. They need to put the App at the same level as the content."
Derek Schaller,"Ridiculously poor sorting and filtering options just to browse movies. Browsing by genre is limited and doesn't include rom-com. Can't sort by release date, etc."
Lamar Smith,I like the app and the movies offered.
Alex Zaragoza,Netflix is better
melisa penkert,great show options
siamak attarian,It is verrrrrery laggggy

Jose campos,I like it
Mark Gaines,excellent app
chris mills,love it
Kimberly Skalyo,We need to have more newer movies to stream!!! why is it taking so long to go from movie theater to streaming or even to buy?!
howdy yall,"I payed a little over 15 dollars for an app that does not work. The titles available are great. The problem is I cannot watch any of them for more than a few minutes without the screen glitching out beyond recognition. I have tried connecting to different wifis, even clearing the cache. Nothing fixed it. Would stick to something more reliable like Netflix, Hulu, etc."

Shirley Byrd,love it
Alex Hansen,"I just redownloaded the app, and I usually don't have problems with the apps, but when I tried to watch stuff on my phone, I could hear sound but still be the loading screen. Then, a System UI not working notification would pop up, forcing me to restart the phone. I tried multiple time to watch a show on my phone, but the same thing kept happening."
Jessica Williams,Max has alot of great shows that I enjoy. I use the app on my phone with no issues at all.
Zachariah Butz,I like max it is good
Just Teresa,Supposed to have gotten this as a free service when I purchased my home internet in December but per T-Mobile and their scamming and false advertising I didn't receive this service therefore other than to say it was just baked to get me to sign up for home and now that the APC program is is over and my discount is no longer I will be transferring to spectrum as their services $99 instead of $55
Leonardo Souza,"Poderia ser mais clean a p√°gina inicial, mas amo os conte√∫dos"

Azucena Reyes,Doesn't have all Impractical Jokers episodes
k jones,not update to the latest episodes
Krlos Reyna,T√≥xicos
Andy Berks,Downloads not available offline. You have to login online to access downloads. This is seriously idiotic.i will be reducing my subscription level next renewal. So you can't use this app on airplanes.
ImpactwithPurpose,Needs More Movies Selection
Joel Basto Gonz√°lez,Just great content!
Richard Gear,"Fine app, but why does it need to share any of my personal information (especially location) with third parties. I'll stick to just using Max on my television."
Amber Osuna,could use more scary movies
Yooso _,It doesn't work at random times and they don't help in their web.
David Colvin,I hate this app but I still pay for it
Christie Burt,nice
Sylvia Cox,"This app works part of the time with me on my phone. On the TV it runs well, with only occasional hiccups. But on the phone it never runs smoothly, the phone is up to date and so isn't the app. So I don't know what the issues could be."
Isidro Garcia,add more good movies
A Google user,"lots of good movies. Larry Sanders, curb your inthusiam is worth it right there"
Dro Dominguez,love it
Landwell,Very good very great
Chris Hoke,The Big Bang Theory is my favorite show of all time.
UraqtHotline,I would love this app if it worked on my phone. I get an error every time I try to watch something. I've gone through all the troubleshooting and it works well on my Chromebook. The old app worked on my phone but since the update I can't watch anything. Otherwise I enjoy the app on my Chromebook
Sam Rubi,Huge fan always loved Hbo.
Bertrum Pe'a-Antonio (Eosefa or just Sefa),very good
Google User,Has some of the best documentaries!
Yamil Vallejo,Love the HBO and Max content hate the update. Makes it really difficult to watch what you really want to watch and continue watching were you left off.
Tracy Capinera,"works great across all my devices including Chromebook, I can download movies/shows"
Rick Targaryen,Deve melhorar o app cont√©m falhas na fala
Natael Morales,good

Lindsey Chastain,Aquaman. Was awesome Jason mama damn he's fine

Josh Smith,poop deck fer sure
Timmy Bass,price little high should be back too 1499 who cares about dolby atmos
Catherine Petrucci (Cassie),lov it
Jonathan Lorenzo,App muito ruim para celulares
Aneley Santamar√≠a,"Son unos ladrones, que te cobran sin falta la suscripci√≥n, no te dejan ver el contenido y te mantienen en un loop infinito de soporte t√©cnico haci√©ndote hacer las mismas 20 pruebas desesperantes una y otra vez. Si quer√©s ser feliz, dale la baja a Max y contrat√° cualquier otro streaming."
Alex H.,"I love it! it has all the classics that others don't, adult swim is a channel. I love it, it's also easy to navigate and a fair price"
Kellye Hunter,Downloaded shows can't be stored for any significant amount of time. We travel a lot and like to download episodes of our favorite shows for viewing in places where there is no internet. tmThe inability to do so has been a very disappointing aspect of your service.
Link Ultra,"Max es una compa√±√≠a c√≥mplice del asesino Espa√±ol Daniel Sancho, se tomaron el tiempo de hacer un documental tratando de blanquear la responsabilidad del asesino junto con Rodolfo Sancho padre del asesino. Una total verg√ºenza mundial."
Denise Rousse,Desde que cambio a Max no pudimos ingresar m√°s a la app desde la tv. Solo es renegar.
Dentry Perkins,Great
Matias Fabiano,Rated 3 stars due to the annoying message asking to rate the app.
Wilma Matos,"Awful update!! NOT user friendly. You complicated our experience in the app. With the new update for Firestick, now we don't have available the option to continue watching a movie, series or documental. Neither the new shows or my watch list. Now I have to navigate to the left looking for the ""my stuff"" option and then keep looking and looking... for the show I want to watch. 0/10!"
Jonathan Pena,awesome thanks
Clay Adams,It kicked me out of my own devices
Eddie P,badass
Rodrigo dos Santos,Yo pay for something that has ads. It's not worth.
Dariann Taylor,it's awesome
Aubrey Burrows (blondieXD),Constantly crashes and freezes. It's so bad I have to restart my phone just to access anything other than a black screen.
Luiz Carlos da Silva Carmo,"o som ficou muito baixo depois da √∫ltima atualiza√ß√£o e ainda n√£o da pra personalizar as legendas, no meu dispositivo as legendas ficam praticamente ileg√≠veis"
Leon Ramirez Guarin,El audio see reproduce pero el video queda en negro
Matt Dallass,"HBO Max was more beautiful and easier to navigate! Even the color scheme was WAY, better! Having a dedicated DC page should come back please!"
Hipparchus,"Can't log in. Says I failed a captcha, but it's an app and there is no captcha."
Duron Moss,Max is absolutely üíØ üî• üëå
Juan Carlos Barajas,"Desde que migraron a Max ya no hacen res√∫menes de los partidos de champions league y no hay tiempo para ver todos los partidos. Tambi√©n ya hay un apartado de champions league para ver los partidos pasados, hay que buscarlos con su nombre en espec√≠fico"
Mikey Mast,They have great movies to pick from.
Chris Vanhoose,Annoying. Makes me re-sign in on my TVs like once a month.
Bertrand Miles,Awesome!
Jaum Cardoso,quero assistir a Champions e o aplicativo simplesmente fica carregando pra sempre. desinstalar e instalar de novo n√£o resolve
Alexandra,"I love this app! üòÉüëèüéâ. This app has the best movies and the image quality is awesome. It's easy to navigate on the app, everything flows smoothly and now when I'm watching a movie it doesn't stop out of nowhere, there are very good and notable improvements, I love HBO and its allied brands. üòÅüëèüôåüéâüéâ‚ú®‚ú®"
Heather Earnest,Glitches sometimes but other then that i enjoy the app. Get it through my cell phone service.
Stephanie Saravia,always technical issues on app and on Roku UPDATE 4/10/24 APP HASN'T WORKED FOR ALMOST 2 MONTHS. CALLED CUSTOMER SUPPORT JUST TO BE TOLD THERES NOTHING THEY CAN DO. IF ITS 70 HOURS PASSED YOUR CANCELATION. SO MY TIME AND MONEY PUT INTO A PRODUCT THAT DID NOT DELIVER WHAT THEY PROMISED!!!?! SCAM ARTISTS!
Clay Mullins,Got tricked into installing by ad
James Ritchie (Melfina Kay Delray),dex error it will let you scrow threw with the keybord but not the mouse it did before the version of the soft were update that i got
Araceli Delgado,Good and awesome üëåüèº
C√©sar Ruiz-Morales,"Easy to use, easy to find something enterteining"
Bobbie Shoub,max has been great minus when it randomly freezes and I have to completely close it out and start it up again
ciera feuchten,"Not very user friendly. If you want to choose a different episode of something you're watching, this is the ONLY streaming service that forces you to click play on the show THEN click back/return just to get to episode selection. Will ALWAYS play previously watched episodes starting at the last 10seconds of the episode so you might as well select the previous episode because it'll say ""playing next in 15"" regardless of which you click."
Natasha Hutson,Keeps force closing video when I try to play video. FIX IT
Dee Johnson,Constantly loses place on things I'm watching making me find which episode and how far in I am almost every time. Update: about a year later and STILL crashes any time you open another app in background or visa versa. Still cannot save the place. Ridiculously worse since they changed to Max from HBO Max which is a common sentiment in all the reviews. Generic replies on reviews to make it look like they are listening but that is the last message you ever see from them and no changes whatsoever.
Brian Hart,It's a rabbit hole of entertainment
Colleen Freeman,love the choices
Bridgette Hester,my favorite streaming app!
Gage Morgan,HBO Max better
Lucas Alamini,The layout is so much better
Harmony Woodbine,I'm trying to put my account to the max

Joseph Lincoln D.,"Please some data saver for live streaming content, love to watch UCL but it drains my internet when outside home"
Thorneal Robinson,Really great streaming service with tons of movies and shows.
Luis F,A lot of dope content. Would recommend to a friend. or enemy
Sebastian Ponce,muchas peliculas nuevas
christofur bup,"I wish you offered more anime, like you used to. But other than that, I've nothing negative to say about Max."
Pam Stein,"In my Samsung phone, play the trailer but not the movie. Message: there's a problem with your device settings. Uninstall the app and here it comes again. Dissapoint. ü§Æü§Æü§Æ"
Robby Rich,App works good. A little pricey for me though. most apps are though.
Candy North,it's got the best shows. it's even got friends.
Sam Krupinski,great streaming service. the best library fir me. My favorite streaming service!
B,One of the most poorly designed app I have used. No way to globally turn off subtitles for Android phone or android tv. Of course the morons who are supposed to hel with support deflect and refuse to address/fix. Every show you watch you have to turn them off. Interface is very poorly designed for watchin sports. They don't break the sports into categories and you have sift thru every sporting event to find what you need.
Bre C,"I can barely hear anything. Netflix and literally everything else I watch is fine, so it is definitely the app."
Henry G,great choices to watch
Laila Zarate,Each time i want to watch something it would only show the picture and under other movies but i cant watch them
B,This app has no setting to turn off subtitles. Every show you watch you have to turn them off each time.
Tyteez,The streaming quality is poor should not matter how much you have to pay you should be able to see it
Jason Lund,"my favorite collection of movies, as well as their originals being my favorite original series from any streaming company."
Herman Bartley,Max charged me for two active subscriptions since it changed from HBO max to Max and I never had a chance to file a claim
Albertguti Guti,Black screen loging in with provider
Jose Reyes,Keeps crashing
LILLIAN CHAPMAN-SMITH,I love it to watch any kind of movies
Okho Ajake,thanks u god bless amen.
Tanya Williams,easy and simple to use. I'm seeing more of my favourite shows. I wish property brothers started from season 1 and not 8
Fire ‚ÄúFed Up Fire‚Äù Lieutenant,the app shows gray letterbox bars when watching HDR content. The only way to get rid of the extremely distracting very light gray bars is to turn off the HDR content. This only happens on the Android TV Max app it never happened with the old HBO Max app.
Cheryl Lord,Having trouble getting the picture on the cooking channels
·¥†Õ† üÕ†·¥ÄÕ†·¥Ö,GARBAGE!
Destiny Oliver,max has so many good movie night shows also movie try max out and if you like just go from there and try max out
Uni belt,üëçüëçüëçüëç

Jacob Mahon,Excellent.
Rylan Blaine,"I love this app, it has everything I love to watch"
Jackson Triplett,Max is the best movie app to use I love it keep up the good work
Guilherme Leite,"Aplicativo da TV √© simplesmente um lixo. Imposs√≠vel assitir qualquer jogo ao vivo na TV, pois a imagem fica travando o tempo todo. Na HBO Max n√£o tinha esse problema. Agora pra completar v√°rios filmes est√£o com esses travamentos. O problema n√£o √© internet, pois minha velocidade √© de 350MB. Isso √© pregui√ßa em otimizar o aplicativo l. Servi√ßo caro e nem sequer entregam bem o que prometem."
Katrina Gove,"Absolute garbage. How this app was released as the finished product baffles me. It takes you on a constant loop of signing out then back in, the connecting with your provider, then back again. And I have to repeat this dance every single time. I can usually eventually get the app to play whatever I'm trying to watch, but only after 15 minutes of fighting with it."
michael pellot,"Home screen change after latest update, can scroll down to see latest watched, kind of idiotic"
Slay Blaze,need max
Nad Nasul,"Having an Octa-core processor & running on Android 13, it looks like I'm watching YouTube at 144p trying to use this new app, the other platform was way better... Y'all need to fix this ASAP! ü§¨"
Estephanie Raygoza,love it!
Jeremy Meade,awesome movies and shows!!!!!
Jerry Moore,really good a application
cody bale,sick
Earl B Jacobs,Excellent program.
Emily Miller,Alot of show options. Happy to see newer released movies such as Wonka and Aquaman 2 that is already available to be streamed free with no extra charge.
MrNunyoBidness,consistently works
Megan Hamlen,The shows on there that I've never even heard of I'm enjoying it so far
Nanny,"A vers√£o com an√∫ncios tem muito excesso, voc√™ assiste mais an√∫ncios do que est√° realmente interessado."
manly gator,awesome
Stephen Boudreau,"The options are great, never get bored. But if you want more stars from me. You need to add a feature to say you don't like something. Something looks good then 10 minutes later it is awful, and it is at the top of your list every day. And you don't f.... want to watch it. But you shove it in my face every day, and there is no way to say hello that sucks and is offending to me"
Jane Smith,it's really nice and I can watch godzilla on here
KING MASHA NELLOMS,ITS KOOL
Melissa Messersmith,"There is no way to reset a series. When you go back to watch it again, it plays the last minute and goes to the credits. Super dumb. People have been posting about this for YEARS, and HBO just doesn't care about their users. They know people will pay anyway. You must have really dumb developers."
Angel Diez,excelente
Edwin Ramirez,Live TV would be a nice addition
Orlando Varela,Max is The Best.
Roberto Santiago,luv it the best streaming service
Sarah Wood,i hate HBO for taking my john Oliver. im forced to suck up to HBO if i want to watch good stuff
GeshGamer,Amazing app!üåü

Carolina Arias,App keeps signing off every time app tab is closed.
Jesus Espinoza,my favorite streaming app
Rafael Pe√±ate,"Los cap√≠tulos de Sex and the City de la primera temporada est√°n desordenados, tienen el t√≠tulo seg√∫n como deber√≠a ser pero al entrar al cap√≠tulo resulta que no es el que he seleccionado. Vi primero el cap√≠tulo final de la primera temporada y el √∫ltimo fue el cap 4. No est√°n en orden."
Marissa Smith,"Idk, I try to watch something on my phone and I pick my show I want to watch, it loads but then goes to a black screen and the sound is there and captions and you can read them but doesn't have a picture.. I have to open and close the app a million times before I can get it to freaking work. And then when I do finally get it to work I'll be watching my show for a minute enjoying it and then the picture wants to freeze and the sound is still going.."
EM Rebolledo,Great entertainment!
Anita (Anna),the best TV app
Eric Bradford,"love this app! has great content, can't think of another that can compete"
Jacob Parlier,LOVE IT!!
Salvador Gutierrez,"Everything is good. The only issue I have is that when I download things, I can't watch them. Is the purpose to download is to watch without buffering and not offline?"
Matt Wilkins,Great content! But the app is slow and buggy. I literally cannot seek in an episode. The back 10sec button does nothing. Dragging the play position in the timeline does nothing. Pretty basic feature for a media app in 2024. Or even 1994.
Jon Peck,I like the content but the media player has gone crazy. It now plays the next in series wether I set it to do so or not. Once the series is finished it won't let you watch it again. The on screen controls are completely unresponsive. I have to bring up my phone's menu just to get a pause button to even show up. It worked great right before the last update and I would really like to see it fixed so I can get back to enjoying the app.
Vladimir Cruz,amazing
Eduardo Zamora,"This platform is garbage. The content in the brands like Max or DC cannot be separated into films or series, which is annoying to look for content. The a-z menus do not even appear in alphabetical order, which even suggests that they may have monkeys as programmers. It is plagued with stupid carousels like ""culinary adventures"". The standup specials are mixed up with random content for inexplicable reasons. The former platform had menu options that are gone. It's a total downgrade from HBOMAX."
Joseph Fechter,"Have never used the Mobile App very much but as a Streaming App it's amazing. Too bad the free sports will probably end soon, wish they would at least keep TBS as part of max..Peacock streams NBC. Love the user interface, functions as it should though it looks bland."
Ceasar Diaz,Great App
Rachel Ortiz,"excellent, love it"
bubba c,very happy üòÅ
Enya Mercado,"problemas cuando veo, no s√© si sera cuestion de mi dispositivo o de la aplicacion (porque no me pasa con ninguna otra) que a veces no me deja retroceder y Tengo que salir y volver a entrar de la pelicula o serie para retroceder."
Leandro Coceres,Well done guys
Chad Wenn,"Casting feature does not see devices. Hulu, Netflix, and other competitors can cast without issue."
Casey Barclay,"I think this might be the first app I've ever left a review for, but my experience is so bad that I have to in hoping that they will fix it. To preface, I never have problems with streaming the shows on the app. My problems come from streaming sports. I watch hockey and basketball both, so I tune into the app to watch games. Every time that I watch a live stream of any sports game, it freezes every 15-20 seconds and pauses for about 5 seconds during that time. It's horrible."
Cheira Sneathen,It's really good
Matthew Tufte,it's fantastic
Gemoee Onsere',Charged my account without my permission. Expecting a refund. Just give me my money back! Then never bother me again!!!!
Lin Quin,"Already broke it. Takes........ Forever.......... To.......... Load...... & has all kinds of problems once it does. I haven't gotten to watch even one episode before it tanks. Looks like they have the same crew as the previous. You should listen to your QA team when they tell you there's a problem. - - - - - Oh, and don't bother with a canned reply, just FIX IT!"
Daniel √Åvila,"Why removing the ""shuffle"" option? I don't get it."
GLSmisfit,dope

Leanna Sandoval,üëçüëç good
Intuition_tellin_me_there'll_be_better_days,love the DC content but sooooo much is missing üòï
Joe Trolo,"Update. I am really sick of it automatically putting on subtitles. Then when I turn off the subtitles it keeps the pause play buttons and darkened screen. Using fire tv. I've tried everything, updates, clear data, cleared cache and still doesn't change. I'm going to cancel out of principal if this doesn't change soon. Previous review below Great stuff! Love the 4K and Dolby Atmos offerings!"
Fabian Ruiz,that was awesome
Robert Gordon,good
Carlos W,great

Allan Solano,doesn't work in English
Tracy,exceptional app
Chip B,skiyeet
r c,"watched 5 ads in a row from WayFair. it said enjoy your ad free experience from that point for the rest of that episode. then it proceeds to show me just as many ads as it normally would have anyway. I'm guessing they paid more for those 5 ads and my 'ad-free' experience. you should honor that. also, squidbillies with tracy morgan in it really sucks. I don't care what the first guy to play early did in real life. those are funny af. show those please. decent app in general"
THE TARDIS_ IS_THE_UNIVERSE,awsome app that i ever watched
Enrique Saenz,"works well, but weirdly difficult to find something new and good"
danjely emilio vargas almanzar,Exceptional app!
Jose Meran,add more content
M&E S,You keep me wanting more!!
Victoria Carrizales,"The app worked fine before but now there is no audio whatsoever. Ive tried so many things to get it to work but nothing has worked so far. Edit: also tried all troubleshooting steps, + some extra & filled out a form but recieved no response."
Richard Melanis,love watching Ed Edd Eddie. it's one of my favorite cartoons show to watch. I would recommend this app to family and friends alike.
Godzilla0936,Just use max
Diego Escuraina,great shows
Isaac Quiros,"I love ""House m.d"" and ""The big bang theory"" ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è"
Ray Maiorana,movies hmm
k-rob,"Great content, trash app. If you want to cast to a chromecast, it constantly buffers/freezes. It's not my internet speed, connection or phone. I use hulu, amazon prime, disney+, peacock all with zero issues buffering while casting like this one. It's been like this for many months. HBO clearly doesn't care to fix it. Can't believe such a big company has such a horrible app. EDITED TO ADD: why are we expected to fill out extra forms to give you the same information located here? Hard pass."
D√©bora Porto,looove
just a weeb„ÄÇ,Super good has all shows I love it so much
Money Cold,I love it
partymau5,Seeing ads while I'm still paying for the service is still annoying. Also not being able to download content for offline viewing is disappointing as well.
Kristen Harrison,The app keeps jamming my phone on black screen u can hear the video but not see nothing but a buffering ring and then it just stays like that t til i have to completely shut my phone down and back on then try to rewatch the movie again another 4 times same thing
Tevin Miles,"it is worth it. It's great I can watch DC super hero films, The extended Lord of the rings films and more. and cartoon network shows as well."
Thain Browne,basically a better Netflix/ a movie prodigy only down side is that you have to pay which I just realized-_-
Kamron Higgins,this is a good app
Brent St.Germain,Awesome app!
Joshua Livingston,this is the only streaming service I use.
Andrea Atchison (MommyASKK),"trying to binge is difficult on max, sometimes the screen turns grey when starting a new episode, generally it's just thru the ads (which is fine) but sometimes it goes until you back out and go back in to the episode. when trying to watch the same episode again it starts from the end even tho there are less than 5 secs left in the episode. and you have only that amount of time to start it over."
marlon francisco lopes,Melhorem a transmiss√£o estou vendo a final do paulist√£o e s√≥ fica travando o streaming.
Manuel Nolasco,"Everything in one place, best series and movies, classics of all times and the most recent top rated."
Fabi√°n Cort√©s,Great content. App usually takes longer to load than other streaming apps. A button for 'view from the beginning' would be really much appreciated by app users.
thebeast656,"This is probably my favorite streaming platform. They have a whole lot of movies and even classics that I am able to watch. I am definitely a movie guy, and Max is the movie platform of choice. My only grievance is that my home screen is flooded with sports and I do not watch sports. Max needs to make a way that you can take that off your feed or some type of way to opt in or opt out of sports. Please let me change my UI to my liking."
Carmelo Davila,it's amazing
Donna Vickers,"too many bad movies, not enough decent/ clean movies"
Jesus Reyes,plenty to watch
Maricela Reagan,Mostly good
Israel Rodriguez,The NHL has got me bent over a barrel but good this time. I got this app so I could watch my God forsaken team lose apparently but I'm keeping the app because it appears there's a bunch of good movies and $hit.
Ruben Ramirez,"Really cool reasonable priced app ,sincerely appreciated, Gotta like an app that gives you Sopranos."
Christian Mars,most of my favorite shows in one place. but mostly just Rick and morty
Karla Burleson,"Although your auto fix dialog response is repeated in every complaint in this review section I will write my complaint which Im sure wont be read by a human as it seems Max app still has the same issues as complained about way before mine. I just opted in on this app and all it does is buffer constantly. It's NOT on my end. I have multiple streaming apps and none have this issue. I am considering cancelling before 24 hours of the sign up. Thats pretty bad, MAX. Please fix the issue!"
Rudy Diano,Great shows always something good
Tracy Stokes,POS just keeps crashing over and over again since denying unnecessary cookies.

Lolimar Guzman,buena app
Tiger Rojas,great movies losts of options good quality and great price
Carol M,"Something is wrong. Every time I shut off the closed caption feature, they come back on when I resume watching a program. It happens on my phone and my TV. I just downloaded the app yesterday so I know it is the most recent version. I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice on both my phone and Fire stick. It's pretty annoying and ought to be fixed.. so I filled out the form and nobody got back to me, so the problem persists."
Daniella Cordero Bels,Thief
Eduardo Sanchez,"The brightness level is incredibly low, everything looks very dark. The app needs work"
Lawrence Pede,The quality is like the dial up Internet in 1999. Pathetic. And I have 1 gig Internet with no issues on any other streaming app.
Blake Shealy,i guess its good at least theres no ads
Insignificant User,"aside from some stuttering in the image, it's a-okay"
Michael Palmieri,"FF doesn't work, probably. I can only do 10 second increments. 2x,3x,4x doesn't function."
Daniel Jordan,"Blacking out the final four,first class!!!ü§®üëç"
HazMatt Wilkin,"Really like everything about Max. So far we are liking Max, pun meant, to the Max."
Andi Bitzel,"Good shows and movies, but this app is TERRIBLE on the firestick. It is slow, and the episode time lapse stays the whole episode and doesn't go away."
FRANCISCO ALFARO,GRATE MOVIES AND SERIES...
Blue Magic,it's a very good place to watch movies and your favorite series

Jordan Owens,Awesome sauce üëåüèª
Vivek Rai,best one

Duane Wright,I could not sign in. Worthless app. I tried resetting my password it doesn't work
Fefi Ort,You need to pay
Megan Barrera,"You pay for an app, it should work. The scrub bar that shows the time remaining and captions button refuses to go away"
Jayden Rickell,the best movie app
Avery Eichner,they got rid of some of there best shows
Daryl Roberts,To The Max
Pauly D,awesome
Ricardo Hernandez,üëç

Ashton Carter,great selection of shows and movies
patricio vega polanco,cool
Nettie Walker,I haven't watched yet!!
Edward Peters,need different movies then same old repeats
Hannah Griego,"Watching soccer is like watching a pirate feed in 2004. Buffers every 30 seconds, terrible sound that keeps glitching every 5 sec. All of the ""help"" pages say to update max, it's something with my tv, internet, etc. Guess what, it's not. Why pay for rights for sports if your streaming platform can't stream effectively."
Kayla Demars,I love but there has been problems lately
Casey Urbanek,love my max
Roy Ingram,great
Tammy Kleczka,love this
Domo Meo,üíô
tony palumbo,"Terrible. Wish they had negative stars. Try everything they recommend still can not sign in. And since Curb is pretty pretty pretty bad this year, and House of dragon is a bust. Just may cancel"
Victor Hugo Rojas Alvarado,App is faster than Hbo Max.
Butters _,like whats on here
Robert Kerecz,"Idk who they are paying to delete neatuve reviews and leave 5 stars, but last time I checked the app had like a 2 star rating. It's literally,by far, the worst streaming app our of all the major ones. Absolute garbage"
Bob,"Its awful,keeps pausing and buffering"
David Lee,too long to reset passcode very confusing very confusing and I can see they don't let you send it if you're leaving something bad unbelievable or it could be me I'm absolute no
Patti Hinojosa,Max has the greatest movies
Travis Bruce,awesome
Erik Wilkinson Jr.,1 of my top 5 apps to watch
L B,"Max does not support smart view for Samsung phones . So if you have a Samsung you cannot cast from phone to your t.v. Hbo max used to support it. I don't know why it's so difficult for max to fix the issue. Fix your app already max!!! I pay extra on phone bill to have max but not able to stream anymore üò¨üòíüò° to many ads ,I may as watch free apps with as many ads you have added! Fix your garage & u will get more stars!!!"
Rafael Reyes Rodr√≠guez,excelente
Z Brockhouse,still awesome
Simone Nyota,"This service has a good selection of shows but sadly that's all it has going. Not only does the app constantly crash, it makes my phone glitch."
Jorge Delgado,great
Felicia Kelly,"Max sucks, it's one of the most expensive streaming services yet I'll be watching it on the TV & the sound will go out, or it will get so low you can't hear it or it will go static. Then you gotta close out wait a min & go back in to see if it stopped. I've already had to do it 5 times today. None of the other apps do it. Netflix is fine, prime, Hulu, Starz. No issues, its just max. They should take the price down till they get it fixed. It's getting REALLY annoying."
ARC Business,"Un desastre el pase de HBO a MAX. El pago se rebota y eso no es que no tenga fondos. Es falla de la app. Desde que se hizo el cambio, he estado experimentando estos cambios y francamente, NO voy a pasar de HBO a MAX con mi plan para que ahora, deba reiniciar todo o cancelar la cuenta!? Yo pens√© que el cambio, era para mejor. Encima de todo te env√≠an 800 e-mails cada 5 minutos. Cero. Ni siquiera lo veo √∫ltimamente ______So, you change your apps, they do not work and besides you ad ads!? Please!"
392 sCaTpACk,the best
Evan ALFORD,I think it's better for movie watchers and people who enjoy 90's - 2000's era cartoons and adult swim. The Android version is pretty fluid.
shemar 100,it's Great so far
Joan Kerr,"Impossible to find specific movies and series. I can watch The West Wing on my tv Max, but not on this app on my tablet."
Brian Wickham,I love it but kinda wish there was more though
Nashaun Stinner,like it ty

Michelle Cameron,love
Zach Mars,"still buggy, but the content is great."
Julie Wiesner,Reasonable fee for commercial added version
Abimael Lopez,The Best One
bryan bintliff,"fine. works. no longer freaks out when my tablet keyboard disconnects. David Zaslav is a greedy demon responsible for destroying so many favorite shows and also helping destroying the American psyche with reality TV. So, minus one star for him."
Jennifer Vickers,cost to much!
Exdolfin,love it
tadly23,Update:its more stable now on mobile however sometimes when I'm on my data a green screen bug happens i fixed it for now by clearing the data out from the app it doesn't normally happen on wifi just letting you guys know other than that it's a good streaming app
de secret Doge,80mb!!! üòâ üëç üëç üò≤ Haven't experienced any issues like people are mentioning. UPDATE: How could you betray me like this‚úãÔ∏èüò´ü§öüí•. Please don't go any further than 127mbüòµ.

Leann Harris,I am paying to be ad free why is there ads! Fix this!
J Quin (JQuin),"Update since the latest update. Why is every episode beginning at the end still?? Won't let me watch anything a second time. Not sure why that hasn't been fixed. Fix mistakes, then add more."
Valerie Casey,I just cant believe that I totally had forgotten to check out Max on tv until now.. It has so many great movies!!
Mila A,"significantly cheaper than Netflix, and a primarily better selection"
analicia medina,"Will be canceling my subscription asap!!!! They now only allow 4 devices maximum at all, not even streaming at the same time like hulu! My home alone has more than 4 Tvs that doesn't include my hand-held device in case we want streaming on the go. I would've understood if we couldn't stream 4 devices at the same time, but the maximum of devices that can be signed in is 4 . That' laughable.I know so many others will be going. Since your response doesn't mention the real issue!"
Brooke,"One of the main reasons that I have Max is bc I get to see movies that r still in the theaters. I don't have to wait till movies get out of the theater to watch them. It's very nice. For entertainment apps, it's probably #one for doing it's job. I get to watch films that aren't even out, yet. That part is just too cool. Fr tho. Max is good. I hope it stays the wayt it is for me and my family. So far, Max rocks."
sanchez thomas,it's the bomb
Jon Bayliss,"Pure garbage since they dropped the hbo and added hulu beta, 45+ sec load times, no restart option for TV shows or movies, GTFOH, catch up wit the times already, I don't want to sit thru 5-15 min of credits to restart"

Juan Jose Carranza Rendon,"there are so many bugs, this all needs to improve"
Stephanie Vera,love the series and movies
gabriela arnuero,"I have tried to use it several times, but I keep sending me to a black screen. At the most, I was able to play one espisode of a series. It also has problems whenever I change from app to app. It sent me again to a black screen. I dont know what happened. HBO didn't have this issue, but with Max, it happens every time I try to watch a movie or a series. I am paying for the app, but I cannot enjoy it, so it is really frustrating. You have to solve it soon because if nos it is a waste of money!!"
Talon,good
Jennifer Chadwick,love it ü´†ü•∞

Jay Mason,love it
Candice Hodge,Want to cancel
Gabriel Alexander Lopez,"Ya no se puede personalizar los subt√≠tulos, pero la app mejoro bastante en todo."
Crystal Clark,"Google tv experience is awful. I can't understand how the new app is worse than either the old HBO max or discovery apps. Sound is bad and busted no matter what video I watch, interface is slow, skipping forward is almost unusable. For the cost of this service, this is unacceptable. Update 4/24: sound is still bad and busted (I still have to turn my TV volume nearly double any other app) and now it's unstable and just freezes and locks up sometimes."
Benjamin Hamilton,"Incredibly bad user interface, casting to a TV is so infuriating that is barely worth attempting. The absolute worst experience I've ever had with a steaming service"
Jean Pierre,"bro you get all the mortal kombat fillms, worth it"
Damien ‚ÄúDjizlle‚Äù Randall,best app ever
Michael Sullivan,has lots of movies and shows that I would have to pay for 2 or 3 other services to get
J. B.,Excellent!
William Ewing,"Doesn't save when you finish an episode. If you decide to stop watching after an episode ends, next time you open the app, it brings you to the end of that episode instead of the beginning of the next episode. Even if you start the next episode before exiting, you need to let it play for about 5 minutes otherwise it will still bring you back to the end of the episode before it. It's a bit ridiculous."
Jeff Johnson,"Doesn't run on my Samsung tablet anymore. Will you please send me an older apk, or fix it please?"
Jerome Talton,great options
Vincent Cross,I love The sopranos
scott davis,great content and format
Carlos Figueroa,"it's a very good app, it has really good movies,& the best classics.live it..."

xXTragicDemonxD,It's broken I have a pixel 6 and this app is completely unusable I'm signed in with a account and my network try to load something at all something went wrong then tells me to sign in with my network which I'm already signed in with (update I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and it works no problem still won't change rating till I know for sure it won't do it again)
Grooming at Sniffanies,We absolutely cannot live without HBO MAX!! we love ‚ù§Ô∏è you!!
JC SB,lovely
Shelly Marshall,I don't like being forced to write review in order to watch. not appreciated.
Cesar Martinez,I really recommend HBO. I love it
Manuel Dominguez,always have good shows
Igor Machado,"the button to close the menu, when I'm watching, needs to be clicked several times to work."
Nathan Marsh,It's absolutely horrible on tablets or phones.... cache constantly crashes! Then you have to uninstall app then re download... then sign In watch 2 to 3 episodes then do it again... netflix.. doesn't do this Amazon prime doesn't do this discovery app doesn't do this & I pay less for them then HBO max... you suck....
Raul Diaz,best streaming service
Henrry Veliz,i enjoy the max
Nohe Martinez,lo mejor
Anavid villanueva,You guys took off all the good dc animated movies and some old cartoon network series that was the main reason i decided to download this app im not very interested in using this app
Reany,always something New And exciting
Felipe Rossetto,"It's just unacceptable being forced to watch ""commercials"" even on the paid version...."
Tickbeat,"I can't open it. I tried connecting our Hulu provider, but when I clicked on Hulu, it sent me back to the sign in menu without saying anything. But this might be a problem on my end, I don't know. On the TV though, I had heard that season 7 of Young Sheldon had come out. I looked it up on HBO, but it only ever has season 6, no matter what I do. Did it just not release on HBO even after all this time?"
Gracie Anzaldua,This has a lot of great new and older movies and series . I usually find all that I want to watch on MAX .
Douglas Barbin,"Constantly asks me to connect my provider. Sometimes it works, sometimes I have to reinstall the app to get it to work. This happens at least once a week. Absolutely infuriating."
Luis Imlauer,"Works better than the previous version, no complaints so far"
Edwin Casas,"It doesn't work well on fire tablet I doesn't Auto size screen , I have activated auto rotate but doesn't rotate well"
Joe Yabuki,Excellent
Cam Mackey,Fix the sports streaming. It's literally a joke and the frame rate is horrible when broadcasting anything from TNT. Frame rate is terrible and laggy. Seriously in this day and age you guys can't provide a good streaming experience for live sports? The worst part is TNT has exclusive rights to these games so you can't even watch them anywhere else not even bootleg sites. You guys suck for ruining this
Esse Emme Message,Had to clean data to make it work. But I still prefer the previous app. This one the interface is too big
Shivani Mahabir,excellent
Michael Persinger,cool

Paul Poulin,best deal for streaming services
maribe perez,love it thank you cricket
nicole swank,It's a wonderful app that has a lot of movies and TV series. It is also easy to find movies or TV series that you are looking for and then the feature to add it to your list is also incredible. 5 star app for sure
Tonya Albright,how can I get commercials free
Julio Tc,2 comercial is crazy I pay for a reason your making Blockbuster come back
Lucas Brugnaro Badur,"Still needs a dedicated brightness control. Seems like most Max shows are very dark, even on an OLED screen. Ok experience, but could use some refinement. Edit: sent feedback on the link provided."
Scott / ZEN WOLF Morris,awesome
Jamie Caruso,Good app haven't had any problems and am enjoying watching.
Ellie C,"The shows are great, but controlling the app is a whole different problem. Why does it take 3+ taps to pause a show and it takes a whole minute or more to exit out of the app. I need something to play in the background for work and I'm constantly fighting with this app to check my calendar or pause it when my boss walks in trying to talk. Then I have to wait for the whole app/video to load again to continue watching. Great content but the controls could use some serious work."
Thomas Sandoval,"I'm so proud I can show my kids films from studio ghibli and others from my childhood and enjoy the ones coming out today, thank you Max!!!"
Josiah Garcia,amazing selection of movies
Amy ‚ÄúMs. Beaverhousen‚Äù Walsh,Disconnects all the time so mad
Joey,please make more original series especially horror
Cecilia Vera,The screen of my phone turns black when I try to watch a content. I can only hear the audio and see subtitles. Worst black mirror episode ever.
lena swatzell,So far absolutely great
Michael Greenwood,This is my favorite streaming service! it has pretty much all the programs I would want as an adult.
Lorikeet,Max generally has a great selection to choose from! I hope they keep The Nanny around so I can't get my Fran fix
J Goldstone,love max. take it to the max
Philippe W,Inutiles totales
David Croney,I ‚ù§Ô∏è Max
Dorsey Bennett,great shows a little pricey but worth it.
Slashj 10,"Very bad update, the app logs out of nowhere and when you try to log in, it gives a server error. Likewise, the subtitles cannot be removed, they already appear in each episode or movie."
Pamalia Sims,Constantly buffering even on really good wifi
Elizabeth Thomas,"Audio description won't turn off on downloaded videos in a foreign language. It's so annoying and they haven't fixed this problem yet. It's been months. Come on people! And don't tell me to change my device settings, that doesn't work on downloaded videos. We don't have ANY OPTIONS so I can't watch any downloaded videos that are in a different language."
Simon Gambino,all of the shows & movies have great cinematography
Natasha S,"Can't resume an episode, you always start from the beginning and it won't play a new episode. Can't rewind or fast forward"
Dollicia,will not play
Debi Brasfield,"I love watching shows that have been created and watching movies I grew up with, shows I grew up with and content"
Wayne Hart,always find something to watch that's new.
Kalub Glaze,"good app, does what it says on the tin"
Brian Diego,Ever heard of music torture? Well Max uses commerical torture on their users to spend more money on a more premium subscription. I am seeing nothing but the same GD nacho commercial again and again and again. I don't eat that kind of food. At least make the commercials relatable to users instead of annoying us. It makes me want to quit using the app.
Chad Eggleson,"Horrible. Can't watch TV shows on the app like you can on Xbox, for example, looking to watch some big bang theory, and what a suprise doesn't show up on app. Plus, it makes you re-sign in every week sometimes multiple times. Absolutely ridiculous from a reputable company. They have let there community down in a big way. Wouldn't be surprised if they are losing profits over stupid things easily fixed. Get Netflix it never has problems."
Susan Hover,Seamless
Koz House,Great Variety. Between My wife and the family we really enjoy the app. Never have had an issue.
Austin,This app still needs work. Need a way to make full screen. s24 ultra and I have to watch a tiny video with giant black bars all the way around the video. Please hire some people who know what they are doing.
Nik Echave,best streaming app
Rolando_ Carballo & Sons iron works,"I have Max included through my Cricket mobile service and I have to say that's awesome!!! No extra cost, I watch it on my cellphone, tablet and TV with my mobile hotspot and it works perfectly well. I just need to get me another hotspot or satellite internet service because I run out of data watching a few movies home!!!‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è"
Justin Johnson,1 of my favorite apps!!
Ellie Barlow,it has most studio ghibli moves
Crystal Campbell,Be nice to be able open app without being sent to play store to download everytime only to get to the app store and it not download just let me open it. Frustrating to say the least. Ive uninstalled and re installed multiple times. Other that app is great
Harry Persaud,GREAT!
Kyle B,"Content wise, pretty great. App wise, an absolute mess. Jaw dropping at how incredibly terrible it is. It crashes upon startup EVERY SINGLE TIME we try to fire it up after waking up our Shield Pro 2019. The only solution is to clear the cache/storage options in the app settings and restart it. And then it will still sometimes park itself forever spinning at the logo. Tonight, we were completely unable to watch anything on it at all."
Christian Dominguez,It a really good app!!
Mike Villalta,Hate the fact that there are commercials now üòí
Haiti 5000,Hangs all the time... While Fiber is working just fine . Seems to be their servers .
Demetrous Simmons,bring back all DC animated movies
Keefe ‚Äúkeefer‚Äù Casler,love this app all Mt favorites are here
Jason Lopez,love the variety!!
Alejandra Gonzalez,good movies and shows
Taija Silva,Great selection but BRIGHT BLUE bars are killing the experience
derek vecellio,"All its good for is the actual movies. I had thought I would be able to watch the live sports from MLB to NBA games, but the only way they stream right is if I watch it on my phone. Any time I cast live sports to any device on any internet connection or speed, the entire game will lag and become choppy the whole time, if it actually manages to work without buffering every 5 seconds. Disappointing. Work on your live sports or don't offer them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Christian Ledezma,it's ok ok
debbie prince,great movies and shows!
Anthony Gillis,Can't get anything to play including my downloads.
Ana Mar√≠a Mora Borrero,Awesome .
NESKWGA-FaZe_,"Excellent app, thank very much, But Max needs more movies and series because it's hard find what we're searching"
Dayna Hayward,very nice!
Brooklynn Dixon,"its a great sreaming application, I recommend it for everyone looking for a good time!"
NORMA ‚ÄúBonita‚Äù GUERRERO,love it's
Jeane Sousa,"ainda precisa melhorar alguns pontos, mas atende bem no geral"
Up all night GC,not much to say but it's worth it
Team chivi,good good good good good
Ryan Vickerman,"The UI/UX is delightful...but the product delivery (streaming videos) is absolute hot garbage. It takes over a minute for video to load, and when it does, it's constantly buffering. This is what you do...this is what you charge for. Fix it or, I will be canceling my subscription. I'm glad I didn't pay for a year up front."
Jojo Kness,"This app is always super slow, the UI is unresponsive, and restarting episodes is weirdly difficult."
Haydee SJ (Isha),nice appt. A lot of movie options.
jacob Anderson,what the point in being able to download if the app will not open when there no internet. it will not give access unless you already had the app open. idk about most people other than travel i do not use offline unless i lose internet
Jay C,Cancelled all other movie channels besides this one. Always has a rack of awesome movies
Tom Grabo,"Great shows, terrible app. Crashes a lot especially with PIP or switching portrait to landscape mode."
Renee Smith,"Can't unpause max app, I even deleted it"
Cecilia Segovia,a lot of great shows n moves
Renee Peterson,Excellent viewing
Cesar Gustavo Justiniano Coseruna,Va mal
Chad Nason,"Max always has ads, even if you pay for ad free. Sometimes the ads are of parents sobbing. It's a great way to be reminded of the horrifying aspects of humanity before being delightfully entertained."
Kevin M.,glitches and plays audio out of sync
Shirley Zange,"Great selection, app is easy to use"
OhKitty Odets,easy as pie
Motard Zinn,I like the choices
Gustavo Romero,üòé
Salaat Rivera,There is usually a streaming issue at least once a day where I'm unable to watch. Other then that nice selection of movies and shows.
Hunter Barnes,Max is always my favorite app to watch on! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüñ§‚ú®
Frederick Wap,good luck
Nalin Montez,"changing my rating to 4 stars since customer service is nice and reached out to me while in my frustration. I love my max. I need my max; it's my fav app, but this app did nothing when it came to paying for my subscription. it says Warner medical LLC but billed through Google play. there was nothing in my Google play so I couldn't pay for it. this is so frustrating. now I have to get Max through Amazon prime. why do they have to make things so hard"
Abraham Brooks,!!Awesomeness!!
Rasiba Molena,I just like it. early access is premo!
Omolara Ogunwuyi,great streaming platform! I love how they give you a deal attached to Disney plus for only $10!
Kill Your Tv,Doesn't let you stream to a television anymore so that makes this app worthless and it has commercials lots and lots of commercials and verizon is trying to make me think I'm getting something for free what a joke
Kayla,it's sticks a bit when the video is playing.
T Rexx,It's great to watch what you love on the go!!!!
Doog P,"So I finally got fed up with this obnoxious subpar so-called streaming service with its erratic UI, and now that I want to cancel through the app you people purposely have it made to further inconvenience your customers instead of actually having a smooth service, It's laughable that you rather do some cheap little deterrent instead of actually focusing your money on your improving your service, you want a funny show, how about showing how you people manage this jank so-called streaming service."
Arnold Brigode,Rather not
Diane Wolf,The ease!
4G4E4 l,"Said my subscription had expired, but it's still charging me and won't let me log back in. Every time I try it says finish signing up, then I hit that button and it says ""activating subscription, it loads for about 3 to 5 min before giving me an error. I have still been charged for 2 months of use without access. Super dissapointed, and I can't cancel because it won't finish loading past the error"
TecH NumbeR971,Disney owns this company. Do I need to say anything else? What a bunch of horrible human beings !!!
Tracey Gingrich,amazing
Isaac Dablemont,nice

Kim,"Does not play on TV, only on phone. Can't cast to tv."
DSC JQUERY,Fake Bitcoin
Randy Vega,"barley trying it out, seem cool tho. trying to find some hidden gems"
BlackN CrowR,Well it's working pretty good for now new user so will see how it goes.
Cornelius Hagans,it doesn't work well with Android tablet
Mister Creer,Love it !
MarijuanaMan,Trash app. Never remembers where you left off on a show. Always loads the wrong show and episode upon logging in. Terrible experience.. still doesn't work properly. Barely works on a roku tv. Have to constantly restart my tv just to get this trash to work. It's pathetic how you worthless bastards just ignore all the issues yet continue to increase prices.
T A,It is insane that you cannot go back on the timeline during an ad playing and then you must rewatch another set of ads when you finally can. Hulu is absolute trash.
Dakota Cardinet,"Hulu bring show,me like show."
Bithiah Israel,"I have a tablet and phone. Hulu always logs me out of my tablet. Most people have 2-3 devices: Computer, tablet, and phone. Some have their own lines. Plus for the price there is too many errors and freezing. Please do better. Yall are not $12.99."
Daryl Roberts,Exciting
Cay Hedy,we can't get CBS! this is happening way too much with Hulu. I am going to switch to Fubo!!
Trisha Roubideaux,Everything's great on this!!
Frank Kolodziejczyk,works out well
Colton Leadbetter,No other streaming app makes you leave the Hulu app just so you can go on a browser to input your Hulu account to login. Intergrate it so you don't have to leave the app when logging in to your account.
Kevin Francisco R.,great
Rosetta Jenkins,Priceless
Diego G,too many ads
Keith Goff,"When I want to add a device to stream, it tells me to go to a website. When I log into the website, it tells me to download this app. When I download this app, I see no way to use it to log into my device. So, a whole lot of running around just to trick me into downloading this app."
Rocstar Erica,large selection
Ricardo Zaldana,cut off
Monica Bruckner,My fave!!
Adrian Perez,The keep watching feature works very arbitrarily.
A. Park,great selection...
Alex Sweebe,Too many ads.
Sally Shipman,"Love having my live TV, being able to record shows when I'm not able to watch live, the app let's me set shows to record when I'm on the go."
S G,"What's the point of having a app that doesn't halfway work, play, skips and sometimes just cuts off. If it was free, I'd still want a refund üòî"
Miguel Hernandez,Amazing experience with the Hulu app.
Verner R Fitts Jr,can't watch movies
Jenn Nguyen,It doesn't remember where you left off! I feel like this should be a very basic function and I cannot believe that Hulu cannot make it work when you stop a show and then you leave and you come back you should be able to start it where you need to but what I have to do is hit continue watching let it go to wherever it goes it always restarts a random episode and then you push back again and it goes back to the episode you were on but then it restarts it from the beginning. The worst. Cancelling
javier lopez,Ad supported experience is nearly unwatchable.
Nalin Desai,App is not working on phone.
Jamahl Michael,Good
Bonnie Foss,great variety
Steven L. Watson,finally got more new shows and anime is on point.
Ashley Daniels Mcclellan,Currently showing green screen audio works picture is off also restarted app same thing
Ajay Billings,it's a good app overall. I gave it 3 stars because it regularly blanks out on me and I have to restart the whole thing
Shawn Vargas,It's currently not working on samsung android
Sam B,"It keeps logging me out and I keep having to verify the same electronic that I've been using from the start. They got a bunch of good shows / movies but when I mark I like them or favorite them I won't see them again unless I go to ""my stuff"""
Lori Smutney,"As subscriber, u can watch from anywhere on your phone, anytime."
Lee Lane,I can not watch anything with full bats 5G

Jacey Zuniga,sometimes I will get logged out for no good reasonn. other than that no comp;aints
Shin Kamen Rider 2023,I like it
freezerGLITCHplays,great app
Tricia Brown,great app. but volume sucks compared to netflix.
Gaze Hound,DON'T LET KID USE. all the add now are porn or drug use not family friendly
Charles Porter,way too many commercials
Paul Lofthus,I want to watch 50 first dates
Lilkandy Dames,"Horrible Experience Late last year it was running smooth. Then from January to now, It keeps crashing or pausing for long & saying ""we're having trouble playing this."" Unfortunately, I will have to unsubscribe until you guys can get it together. It can only play good on small mobile devices. Smh."
Rj,"Unless, you buy live tv pkg and pay close to basic cable you get to watch repeated commercials from shows that are from 2006 or earlier..."
Melissa Parrish,Getting very tired of shows abruptly ending or skipping major chunks while using chromecast. I use the same chromecast with many other streaming apps and none of the others have this problem.
Sumit Agarwal,don't bug me to rate
Shannon Morin,LOVE IT!
John LaJoice,has good variety with paid subsciption still comercials lack luster. less is more
Ron Bolton,it won't allow me to download movies
Hapa Fodder,"Great if you like watching every 2-3 minutes of a show... on TV, the app literally black screens or freezes every 2-3 minutes. If you're lucky, maybe once it'll go longer... their ""help"" section says it might be internet, it's not, it's literally just their application, more than likely an issue tied to their advertisements. If only they knew how to program. You'd think a company that has live streaming as their main product would be able to fix this... but it's a known issue."
Kathi Jenkins,"8, 1.30 second ads within a 45-minute show. Screw you"
Wandering Man,logged out of account everyday
Brandon Parra Aguilar,"hulu is a gem in my opinion, countless great shows and movies."
Yesenia Monroy,it was a long time to wait
Guadalupe Yeoman,love it
Will Avery,will not play my videos very glitchy

A K,commercials suck for something I'm paying for
Juan cisneros,Keeps logging me out every time I open the app again.
jodi chadwick,This app is very disturbing. I decided to do the free trial with ads. Every day and every show needs refreshing constantly breaking up the show you were watching. It's so annoying. I was thinking about canceling my netflix and take hulu but after all of the interruptions I am going to rethink my choice.
sharon norman,paused a movie and was unable to resume. simply said they were having trouble playing the video & to try restarting but there was no option to restart. tried many things but video would not resume. wth
Teen Titan GO!,thanks to this app I can finally watch my fav shows like rick and morty
Martha Colon,Cannot remove app
Adam Hines,"Its like they have regressed the last couple years. It blows my mind they would make their app this difficult to use lol. Enjoy your company crashing into the ground. I used to have live tv no adds, never again will I bother with this or any affiliated apps. I'll just pirate all of your content. Thanks for being so user unfriendly."
Meeonze Vernon,To many ads 1 minute ad for like 5 minutes of watch
Jamie Simelton,great content but the price is getting steep :(

Michael Sniff,crash issues
Carter N,amazing app
Vic Ingram,too many commercials
Ashe B,"""We're having trouble playing this"" - hulu. I'm having trouble enjoying your service, when I can't watch anything. Waste of money, might cancel my subscription. Consistently signs everyone out and password does not work causing a multitude of issues."
Gods Son,I have been with you guys since the very beginning since they very beginning of the Hulu app and you couldn't show loyalty and charge me $20 for no ads I've been with you since the beginning when does the loyalty come back into play
Isabel,good but getting very expensive considering alot of buffering
Abigail Knight,It's not working
darkness is life 123,love all the shows and movies. plus what a great price also. definitely recommend to family and friends.
Christine Irene Acevedo,I think this is the best app ever I think if I was able to Give it 10 stars I would
J T,"Logs it out whenever it feels like it, makes you watch a bunch of ads even though they make you pay through the nose for ad free, cherry picks their episode lists so there are only a couple of episodes per season on their shows, and the content available is abysmal. I'm sticking with Peacock- you're watching ads there too, but at least they're not gouging you."
Jeremy William,Either too many ads or too pricey. The amount that it's gone up over the years is ridiculous and 6 x 2 Minute ads for 40 minute show? Might as well watch cable TV instead.
Johnathon Gluhak,random screen glitches
Roman Ceballos Paredes,I love the movies on anime
Kaylaa Saucy,love hulu
Matthew Acevedo,it's great for watching anything you love has variety of options and it's great
Tracy Talley,Customer service doesn't exist. Constant Ads on no-ad subscriptions.

Robbie Errand,It's amazing one of the best streaming apps out there
Spencer Tinsley,app barely works. always need to force quit when streaming to chromcast
Pablo ‚ÄúKloud Nine‚Äù Vales,TOO MANY COMERCIALS/ADS!! I MEAN IT HAS MORE ADS THEN TUBI AND I GET THAT FREE!! IT WAS AN AWESOME APP AT ONE POINT...THE SHOWS ARE DOPE AF THO....ANIMATION TOO!!!!
Emmanuel Gutierrez,if you are paying why still deal with ads?
Caesyn Smith,Better than Disney.
Mandi K,service sucks I can only watch Hulu late at night.
Noah Bryant,garbage user interface despite capable competition to learn from. 80% of tthe content is junk. Prices continue to increase despite quality of content going down.
Leonardo Rios,"Necesita m√°s pel√≠culas traducidas al espa√±ol, igual que Disney plus"
Braden Bergstralh,"I have been trying for days to upgrade to no ads but because it im ""billed through google"" and theres no option for no ads in the store i just cant?"
g,"love hulu! by far my fav streaming platform! always impressed with the selection on there & ive discovered soo many amazing shows/movies I had never heard of or seen before hand. the app is just as amazing as well & have had never had any issues streaming on wifi or while roaming! Oh! and bobs burgers, of course! need i say more? lol"
AJ Usog,WAY too many commercials for a paid streaming service. I could just record the shows I wat h and get less commercials
Kendrick Smith,great
ElvishPigeon,x files is on it no longer free on amazon it's on hulu
Michael Krzys,hulu tv is absolutely trash.
Bhaltair MacIntyre,"I can't stand when my phone times out and I turn on my screen, go back 30 seconds and am forced to watch another minute and a half of ads. Happens no matter how many times I watch ads. It sucks. Fix it!"
Jay Brown,Frequently log me out of the app
foisol sadeque,Very slow always an issue with connecting it doesn't matter if it's phone or on a smart tv. Hulu is just second class tier compared to it's competitors it's easy to see why they're always trying to give away free service during holidays.
Advanced Mechanics,too many ads
Lori Thompson,"I do not have an active subscription with you,please stop trying all my accounts looking to steal money from me."
Jacob Martinez,Ads every second
Rebecca Siegel,Keeps logging me out for no reason.
Venkata Narkedamilli,"I want to give 0 star. But there is no option for that. Hulu introduced adds between movies. That's also fine, but 1 minute add is taking 10 mins."
Z Sandefer,"The content is good, only streaming service that has family guy and amarican dad. But they log you out on all your devices every other week. Talk about frustrating. Not to mention they don't make it easy to log back in. Constant errors and dumb stuff just trying to watch a show. App needs some work on TV and phones. But again good content"
TPA,"I'm cancelling my subscription because you incompetent losers don't know how to run a streaming service. Programs should begin playing immediately like every other service, not after 10 minutes of ""loading"" or whatever tf your incompetent ""coders"" did to the app."
Lydia Crawford,I like watching Hulu for the shows I don't get on Netflix.
Charlie Goodacre,good stuff! üòÑ
Skrilla T.v,slow
Patrick Pierson,"By far above the rest: The best original programming in film & television; best service, best value . . . my favorite streaming service. hands down!"

katnic2817,can't use with smart view which is stupid when you're paying for it
Kathrine E.,"I love your app, but please make the icon match the material you theming. It's been around since Android 12. It ruins the look for people who want to theme the icons. Please? Android 15 is starting beta testing. It's been long enough to make it match. Thanks."
Richard Porch,Awesome app I love it
Tammy Britton,none of the shows will load

Santrell Williams,won't let me sign in into my account
Linda Guerrero,love the Hulu app and service
Califa Knowles,Nice
Melissa Fisher,optimize video means make it dark and glitchy. hangs up every night.
Kandyse Stark,very good video quality
Chris Leonard,"how many times is this trope going to be done before you, executive producers, realize you're all doing it wrong?"
Joe San Miguel (Smokey),it's OK doesn't stream well on phone not even on Xbox and also always has problems resuming on different devices when i switch from device to another device it's always starts at the beginning it's so annoying but other than that it's good just wish they had more shows and movies to select from hopefully they read are reviews and change some stuff
Devin Redd,Still can't see gift card balance.
LUNA,App and on the TV I can't watch my shows because it keeps giving me playback failure üëé
Christal Goode,bad service
Chazs Thornton,awesome
Eliana Klein,Won't load any video. An error comes up on most of the videos and my wifi signal is strong. Just frustration.
Nathan Allen,I love Hulu. It's another great streaming service with download options. A+++
Morgan J,Do not trust this company. They will steal your money and the customer service is non-existent. I've been trying to contact them for weeks. I signed up for their live streaming program. I think it's costing me about $90 a month. I've since canceled. I didn't even want to cancel but after trying to contact them over 10 times I had to
Eric Slocum,Doesn't work with VPN
Jennifer Ice,hard to navigate selection is so-so
Felix Lopez,5-6 minutes of adds for one episode of 24 minutes is absurd. worst than cable at this point
Tr√© Oliver,Refuse to play on a phone that came out last year.
Pamela Perry,awesome
Carrie Baine,Why doesn't Hulu offer a free 30day trial? At least give you a chance to see if you wish to keep the subscription.
Austin Shaski,unexpected error the time
Majorpayne94,"your site crashes frequently, episodes stop playing mid show, and you charge more while also forcing adds."
Jose Let's Play,I love the movies and shows that hulu has a little expensive for no ads though
Xavier Craft,perfection
Jorge Perez-Aguilar,too many adds
Geoffrey Little,"This is not a good app. Stupid thing logs me out EVERY DAY. Netflix app never logs me out. Prime Video app never logs me out. YouTube TV app never logs me out. HULU LOGS ME OUT EVERY DAY! Most annoying. Enough so we it may end my subscription. We'll see. App stinks, Hulu."
Collin Griffin,"Horrible originals, horrible censorship, horrible agenda. The lamest movie picks, if you like a trilogy, hulu will have the worst one in the trilogy and that's it. Tv shows with one or 2 season when there's like 20 out there. Constantly locking good stuff behind ""upgrades"" which is just buying another streaming platform. Absolute garbage."
Brandy Williams,I can never hardly ever get it to play on my TV sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't there's just a line in the middle
Jerry Fitzsimons,"Interface and password entry is a nightmare. I'm so tired of entering the correct password and it not working. This is on all of my devices. Android, apple ,fire tv..learn from Netflix please. I am using the app from the same ip address always. Your app is so bad. I have changed the password so many times it's laughable. Seriously bad üëé"
Andres Montero,"there is always a playback error, there is always something wrong when I want to watch anything. I have to restart the application multiple times"
George Alexander Thorlton,"Logs me out every day and I have to log back in with my password. I thought I maybe had too many devices registered, but I only have problems on this device, so I don't think that's it. Would be 5 stars, but this is super annoying."
Vish Patel,so many adds in 45 min episode I had to watch 10 ro 12 adds 1.5 min each..
Ted Anderson,very good shows whenever you want anywhere üëç
Gregory Johnson,housewives of Atlanta
Jorge Antonio Uribe (drizzace),love it
Amanda Moore,Good
Jessica Bock,Can't get rid of certain ads. My kids saw a scary ad and there's no way to skip it or even to give feedback on it. Had to pause and send them out of the room. Please add a way to skip certain ads. I would rather watch 2 extra ads to be able to skip ads that I don't want to see.
Jasmine Agosto,love it
tanya eldridge,I love Hulu üòç
PRINCESS BRANDON (Princess BRANDON),nice
Heather Smith,so Carson good
Peter Horton,"I tried to log in on my phone, and I wasn't able to get the live channels for some reason"
Carol Gates,love it tryen to get rid of the cable part
Justin Langerman,logs me out constantly on android
B A,I watch this using a Samsung TV. I am constantly getting kicked off the app. I cannot make it through a 25 min TV show without being kicked off and sent to my TV home page at least 3x. None of my other apps do this and I'm getting extremely frustrated. Especially since I pay about $20 a month for the ad free version. I'm about to cancel.
Rahim Baig,Bring in 1.5x and 2x speed in the player and option to download episodes
Gigi Schuster,"Hulu is not working not on my TV, Phone or Computer and yet they make excuses as if its our wifi is bs. And ya tried to watch an episode or movie not working its $15+a subscription and they won't accept that it's their app. that is the problem.We pay high price for Hulu fix app. now I tried calling customer service was horrible,people were awful with horrible customer service and want to put the blame on the customer saying it's your Wi-Fi anything but their app itself well look at the reviews."
Elayna Shaun Standing Elk,hulu awesome üòé
Azim Chowdhury,I am watching Hulu on my TV I I would give a 5 star bit you guys need to fix this one problem I'm watching my episodes but it freezes an skips I cannot watch my shows properly

khanyiso jona,I think my Netflix has a virus
Raji ojo,OG
Gift Mabel,I hope its ok
Douglas Newton,"Would be nice if there were a way to clear progress when you want to rewatch a series. Currently it skips over what you've watched, so if you try to watch a series from episode 1, it will jump to episode 5 afterwards if ep2-4 were previously watched"
Greekman,"Usually, this app is quite good. HDR support on my phone and on Netfix makes things look better, has everything you really need to do when watching Netflix on the run, watching Netflix on a tablet, or maybe you enjoy watching on your phone even at home. The most recent update even made the ui better but one crucial thing seems to be missing: Resolution. Before you could change it with modes, but now it seems to be gone which is really annoying to me. Netflix please bring back!! Otherwise 10/10."
Laurence Wilson,I'm not using Netflix
Mercy Ancajas,bad
Kahutiah Kiripatea,All ways have update
Js Joshua,"Thui stupid technical Netflix , automatic signout and i all lost my download, useless app, give me back my data."

Rejoice Sola,Why is it refusing me to watch movies saying my device is not part of a certain house hold?? Its now irritatingüòî
Kimberly,"Limited devices in limited locations. It's tied to a household. Want someone outside the household? Pay extra, and the amount is limited by how much your plan is. Pay extra to stream at the best quality picture. For 1 add-on, you pay MORE, then basic services, and at least you'd get two devices with your ads. People rewatching the same couple shows is only going to get the company so far. Try some quality üëå new shows and less on tracking people and charging more. Greedy, very obnoxious."

Jordan Ostrander,"While it has some great shows, it keeps cancelling shows on MAJOR cliff hangers that were actually pretty popular i.e. the society, winx, insatiable, baby sitters club, teenage bounty hunters, and so many others. All of these had wide fan bases and had the possibility of becoming bigger than they were. Netflix blames it on covid, but its been 4 years since covid. Furthermore netflix is worth 265+ billion dollars thry can bring these shows back."

J,they offer specials and change the price every chance they get.
Aurora Ponce,The new update sucks and the household rule is annoying cause you need to be connected in the same wifi connection. They didn't even think that if you travel and want to watch netflix on the way you can't login or watch when your family is watching in your house at the same time. Too greedy that they want you to subscribe if you weren't in same household.

Bala Krishna,Hi and expensive
Kid ‚ÄúSquid‚Äù Squids,"heyo just found out that ads pause if you alt tab on the desktop version that makes this the most worthless app on the planet. NEVER get advertised to and never ever ever EVER let them take your money. If you got a rich friend, borrow their password. If you don't, pirate their garbage (as in, breaking bad and dungeon meshi and that's like it for good netflix content) and let the company BURN."
Ilacixem Flores,"While I have enjoyed Netflix, I find it highly confusing how they get rid of good shows. To my perspective, I think it could resul more profitable to allow customers to be able to choose what we watch and like to keep around in stead of just stuffing the app with all sorts of nonsense options/movies/shows. Netflix used to be of better quality, meaning it used to have better content (more family oriented) and now it just seems to be aiming to delete the worthy of keeping fam oriented shows."

I've tried deleting the cache, uninstalling then reinstalling, but it only works on my TV. My phone is brand new and the internet isn't the problem either. This is ridiculous that this problem has gone on for as long as it has."
YOGESH THALA YOGI,"Need to improve Netflix's timing and continuity of episodes when it is casting series.... Most of the time the series is only having the half of the season either from the start to the middle or from middle to some extent..... Even if they are having on going series, the timing for new episode release is very poor like even the piracy site, other websites in chrome or telegram channels are releasing the same episode before Netflix (few days- one week before itself or few more weeks).üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü§ß"
Ayush Kashyap,"Ohhhhhh, MG. Next level application this is."

Kylie Smith,"Was great before but now they keep kicking you off if you don't live in the same household and it's stupid. I don't even live far from my family member that has Netflix and they do that. They also stop finishing good series, and for what? You want to make more money, finish the series so people will actually keep watching and will have a reason to keep Netflix because all of the other shows and movies are not great. Edit: Again they got rid of the household thing but it's back again."

Javier Blac,Still da best streaming app
Sarah Greiner,I am part of my household. Stop locking me out of my device you greedy useless company.
Anthony Guilfoyle,Man I just wish they could add a series in full for once. It feels like every time they get you hooked on a show and then you can't even finish it like I don't even trust watching shows on there anymore. The only shows they seem to be interested in posting in full are the ones that they make and I get it from a money making stance but I shouldn't have to buy another service just to complete a series
Aurora Baker,Netflix household is absolutely stupid and I will be cancelling my account. Me and my son that is away at college are the only ones on the account and it is all of a sudden saying that neither one of us are a part of the household. Neither I or my son has set up a netflix household and now I have to have temporary access to an account that I pay for. The only way to set up a household is on a tv which neither me or my son use and I can't find a way to fix the issue from a computer or my phone

Melissa Catlett,I'm in love with stranger things but I got a free thing that I never have to pay for
Charlie Two Teas,A far worse experience than using a browser. Adverts for mobile games right in your face as soon as you open it. Like all the other websites pushing apps they are deliberately making their own product worse in order to satisfy shareholders
Patricia Borelli,Great saving my films
Angel alpha6,Srsly Netflix what the hell is your problem? There are 6 devices connected to one account and 2 are shutdown already but i didnt care cuz it was just tv BUT NOW EVEN MY PHONE. I cant send the code cuz its my Aunt who holds the email itself. FIX THIS
Sigfried,"What can I say, the content is mostly good but the app sucks, I have no control what so ever on the resolution I'm watching the videos in, doesn't support split screen or even landscape mode Still don't know if 4k is available again. It's becoming difficult to justify the price."

Kenny Cooper,"I have Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Max, Pluto, Tubi, and a few other apps on my TV however Netflix is the only one that freezes and it's not like the others do occasionally; they don't ever. Netflix however does it not only daily but sometimes 3 or 4 times, to the point I can't even watch it. Don't waste your money! Get any other app you'll be better off."
Joshua David preece,"The app is good but the anime language and subtitles are region-locked. Even though it has dub and sub options but its very limited majority arent in my language, and the bad part the anime's i know of already has english adaptation and subtitles , I hope this can be fixed because I'm not willing to change the region just to have it in my language it should be useable for anyone in any country so for those who live in foreign country to me doesn't feel fair if they can't watch properly"

Doel Nath,"App is inusable. Keeps freezing no matter what I'm watching. Once it said I wasn't logged in when I clearly was, & asked me to use the account as a guest. Restarted the app, it saw me as ""logged in"" again. Haven't been able to watch anything since yesterday cuz all the videos keep freezing/take eons to load. My app is updated. Random shows show up in my watched list that I've never watched or even interested in even tho no1 else is using the slot. Same with a frnd who pinned his acc. Fix ur app"

Mad Hatter,"This streaming service was only worth it when we were allowed to share accounts. Increasing the price and adding a new charge so we can share is what ruined you. Especially since all that's offered is woke Netflix originals no one wanted. Your anime selection was also garbage. The only way to redeem yourselves, allow us to share our passwords for free again and make the price less than $10. Even $10 is a stretch since a lot of your shows and movies are available elsewhere for free."

·¥°·¥Ä Ä·≠Ñ·¥ò·¥Ä ú·¥Ä·¥Ö…™‡øê,Fantastic
atnaveen kumar,There is no options to opt audios in our regional languages as in amazon disney hotstar etc. Example -Gunturu kharam is original telugu movie. It shows audio available in kannada malayalam etc. But on clicking on audio option it was only Telugu and not audio not available in Kannada . Wastage of my money for netflix subscription
Parth Pandya,App is good but all movies are very costly this is the bad manner you know.
SAMSUDIN,Kacau
Isabella Ikechukwu,P guess
Hiba Zahra,So cool lots of movies and films
Bedford Stuyvesant,Super annoyed - borderline pissed. I pay about $21 a month for Netflix so I should be able to watch It on whatever device I choose. this app sucks and it's really pushing me to cancel my entire netflix account. Yall need to fix this bs immediately.

Ruth E. Claudio Rodriguez,"Best of the best in its category!! I have a LG G8 THINQ with Android 12. Ever since my provider who is TMobile gave me free Netflix, I have had no problem with the quality of its content or streaming. I have darken my screen and have ""data saver"" so I can save battery usage. I read very carefully reviews from people who have my type of cell phone so I can know if the app requires an update."

Kara McAbee,I have been on the same netflix account since it came out. I have officially been kicked off because I moved out of the head of house hold account. I have lost all of my shows I've watched. Awesome.

Eram Rahman,this app is very good to see and friends I am rating this app 200/200ü•≥üéâüòòüëçi iove this app
George Babai,"Canceled my membership, and it got turned back on mysteriously. It very tight on money this month."
Nathan Urena-Cherry,This app needs a serious overall. It keeps skipping to the next episode when I open the mini player
Bernardo Rick,I won't even say anything. It's just rubbish.
jay sire,Stupidest thing ever My mom literally gets Netflix through our phone plan and of course I'm still not allowed to use it on my phone because I don't live in the same house Maybe instead of doing stupid bs like this yall could actually try to make an accessible user base and wouldn't be losing money Only reason we even have it in the first place is cuz of the phone plan otherwise we wouldn't waste our time and money on this garbage
Herminia C,Can't even load without an error message
Shilly Shally,"I'll be honest, as I've heard stories of friends and families getting kicked off due to not being in the same household is honestly creepy. Them monitering who's on what wifi to see which one is the main household is disturbing. I understand you're trying to get every dollar you can, but I feel like this is too much and an invasion of privacy. I'm sorry to say my family will be taking our services else where."
Jaimelyn Salazar,Not for free

Mohammad Iqbal,Love watching their shows all the time
Peyton Moser,I love it especially for road trips or shows that are only on here.
Maya Lail,this has the most amazing things ever.
z ingallina,They took away the cast button unless you pay more. Absolute garbage.
Let MFP,"Great overall The reason why I gave 4 stars is because even though i've been using this app for 9 years now, I find it lose its meaning. What I mean is that other apps are upping their games, leaving Netflix as a weaker app due to the other apps buying more content. Amazing overall, recopmmend completely, however netflix, please buy more movies. That would help add that extra star."
Darrell Marks,"This is by far the worst programming app available! Compared to Netflix, prime video, peacock, Hulu etc. Hulu etc. This app is so out of touch and so horrible! It's consistently slow. Whenever you go to watch a program you're at the end and you want to rewatch it. It never starts from the beginning. It always starts at the end and then you get stuck trying to get it back to the beginning! It will constantly freeze up and I have a 1 GB fiber connection. There's no reason for this app to freeze up"
Connor B,Videos crash and buffer when I have zero issues with other streaming apps. Often times UI won't load at all and you're left with a deathly blue glow.
Percy Loli,"Good selection, but the app is still buggy. It doesn't load all the time, and you have to reinstall it or fully close it and reopen it to start to work. Otherwise, you'll be watching a loading back screen for hours"
Michael Meagher,Great app but I can't get half of the movies to play video
No Name,Has the shows I enjoy watching
LoriAnn Schekman,"IS MOST EXCELLENT WITH LOTS & LOTS OF ENDLESS MISCELANIOUS CHOICES ""GALORE-GALORE"" SHOWS & THINGS 2 EXPLORE,WATCH & LEARN ABOUT,ETC. ...

Collin Butler,App not opening
Gary Flamme,Wonderful but just a suggestion Please you must do better on taking movies out and bringing different movies in I know you do it occasionally with one or two But if you expect continued streaming the every month diversity MUST BE BETTER
ed swecker,Great app when it works 50/50. New Android update doesn't work on my galaxy phone at all. Crashes every time I try to watch any video.
Michael Deas,"App does not load unless you close it and then open it several times. It also deletes qued downloads whenever the connection changes. Aggravating! Keeps getting worse, had to uninstall. Let me know when you have it fixed."
Gabriel Quintero,Great'
Tough Beifong,"I am blind and use a screen reader. There are so many unlabeled buttons making this app not accessible. Also, I tried three different shows and was not able to play any of them. Each time I got an error message saying it can't be played right now. So, I was not able to use the app at all."
Isabel Lemus,My favorite is I love Lucy
Nonya Bidnas,Garbage. Can't use vpn and apparently can't cancel subscription.
Chris Nieman,"Technical glitches that prevent me from streaming or downloading episodes on a regular basis made me cancel my subscription. Great content on what is unfortunately the worst platform I have ever used. I only still can watch it because a subscription got added for free to another service, and I have access to an older model phone that can download content more reliably than any of my newer tech. The smart tv version of the app is essentially useless."
Wolfram Arnold,"Paramount+ has decent contact, such as the Star Trek franchise. However, this app is poorly executed and compares unfavorably to its more prominent and long-standing competitors like Netflix. On my Samsung Tablet, it constantly crashes due to some issue with a webview system library. The user interface for rewind and pause is unreliable. This could be so much better."
Daniel Silverberg,"Most garbage streaming service. Expect 2-minute ad breaks even if you pay. For Champions League soccer coverage, don't ever expect to reliably find full match replays. Content randomly disappears and the nav stops working in both the Android and Samsung TV apps. There's ZERO pregame, halftime, or postgame commentary or coverage on any replays. NBC, ESPN, and Apple have much better coverage for their soccer leagues. I dread having to use this service to watch soccer and cancelled my renewal."
Juanita Stidham,Love this app üëè
Marcelo Merizalde,Love this App and the shows ü§ó
Jeanie Hubbard,"My daughter loves it she can watch south park anytime she wants and it's very good she said, she's a teenager and she loves south park and horror movies so she can watch them all the time so this is a pretty good app!"
A M,Always lags. My other tv apps don't. I have fiber.
Jack Tiller,The Best
Bobbe Lynn,Great app. I like the simplicity of the app. It just works
Paul S.,Lots of shows but I'm paying the premium level and still get ads.
felipe m.,The app is okay but the content sucks. The old shows and movies carry a lot of nostalgia but I have little interest in that. All the modern show are riddled with Leftist messages. I the tiny remaining middle are some really good shows that are buried in horrible menus and teaming this ads that run longer than most 30 min shows.
Michael Kirk,Alot of buffering and not many new shows or movies but the shows and movies it does have are pretty good.
Dj Nofix,"Starts over with commercials instead of playing back to where you were at during the streaming, and think a show turned into a different language, last episode was in english, inconsistent.."
Anila Muzaffar,Bruh why does this app constantly need a reinstall? Outsource to Indian fix this Jesus
Tilly Moore,"It is a pain to make a payment on the phone or TV, very frustrating"
Clay Hobbs,It is excellent
Heather Essman,Horrible. Streaming was awful. Canceled my subscription months ago & they just decided to start withdrawing payments again without my consent.
Crank Marc,Great shows and no ads üëå
Taka-i-fonuamalu Tafengatoto-Lui,‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
ThaDapperPenguin,"Even with autoplay on it never goes to the next episode it just stays black, the app for windows will autoplay but everytime it goes to the next episode it exits full screen and quite frequently it'll tell me error 3005 and give me no way to fix it (I have 5g wifi and my pc is connected to the router by a cat6 cable) there's no reason why it should have any issues with paramounts streaming service on the pc. On Android there's no way to fix this issue I've looked everywhere and found nothing..."
Mike Lineberry,Best ever!! Ty!!
Cs Fs,"App won't load, just freezes on the opening screen. Can get in if I go through website. Worked for a little while, now it won't get past the user selection screen."
Miqueas Canales,"This app just does not work, any time I am forced to try and use it cause they managed to scam some poor ip owner into giving them steaming rights, I am disappointed. Bruh I'm just trying to watch the abomination that is ""The Langoliers"" by Stephen King you know? Yeah I can't even watch that, like dog seriously get your act together for real. Ugh anyways I'll probably watch it on Vudu I think it's on there but who knows, these apps be moving stuff back and forth like the worst game of catch ever"
Jason S,I can watch Henry Danger with good Wi-Fi experience
Kevin P. Sheridan,Paramount should fire app developer. Using app on Sony Bravia smart tv to stream ( or should say attempt to stream). First minute of every show is unwatchable due to slow buffering. Have to restart program average of 5-6 times just to capture first scenes of show plot. Very disappointed paying for streaming service to access original content but this app fails to deliver quality experience
Lupe Hernandez,Love this app!
Jason Turachak,I use this app on my Nvidia Shield Android TV ¬°. I have a free Paramount Plus subscription with Walmart+. It constantly freezes on commercial breaks and pops up an error screen. When we try to resume viewing the show after a freeze it starts all over again and we have to fast forward through the show to get to where we left off and watch an additional set of commercials along the way. It takes an hour and a half or more to watch a one hour show. It's very frustrating and makes shows unwatchable.
shona,Great
ken palmgren,I'm tent camping in the woods and tablet is connected by phone hotdpot. Nice to be able to watch TV.
Max Pearson,Terrible. Unable to view mobile past signing in. tech support unreliable too. Ready to end the conversation.
Cedric Brown,It's ok
Heath Foreman,"I love the shows on Paramount, they are the reason I pay for the plus subscription. But the app is horrible. I get freezes and error 3005 on my new LG TV even after all the recommended troubleshooting steps."
Suzan Scott,Great to be able to take Paramount + with me wherever I go !
Opal Johnson,"It makes no sense for this app to only work 50% of the time. As soon as I finish my Star Trek collection, I'll be canceling. This is outrageous."
Laura Drake,Love the shows! Especially Star Trek & Halo!
Yhorm EG,"Brightness is all over the place, never have this on other apps. Will suddenly get very dark and then back to correct brightness about 60 seconds later, will happen about 4 or 5 times an episode, the lighting in my environment isn't changing. Unclear what's happening."
Young Kwok,Good shows for your app is slow takes a long time to flip to episodes doesn't matter if it's on my PlayStation my TV or my phone
Anthony Carlson,"Chromecast broken, starts off playing in fast forward or audio is out of sync. Have to disconnect and recast multiple times for it to work at least for one episode of a show. Installed the app on Nvidia shield and having the same issues."
Cozmo Duquette,Smooth
Artem Krupotkin,Won't launch. Match replays error out. Why am I paying for this???
Jean Toussaint,"Since the new Brasileiro started in 2024, I can't find new matches."
David McCann,Advertisement City!!!
Isauro Luna,"This App absolutely blows on LG TV, why can't you fix it? It's not like we pay a monthly subscription. It keeps freezing ever 5 minutes on a wired connection 400/10 internet speed."
wendy garrett,Love it
Melissa Cox,Crashes and is glitchy with every update
MNM,"If I could give it a zero I would, freezes all the time. You think that's bad? It freezes my tv as well. UI is horrible as well"
Geneva,Did not download
W ‚ÄúTurbo‚Äù H,Nothing like paying for content and getting five ads shoved down your throat every 8 minutes. I can't believe people put up with this disgusting ad ridden world
Kim Carter,I use it daily. Steam CBS network shows. Watch old series like Star Trek. Excellent app.
Timmy Miano,"Great shows, easy to use app, wish I could skip ads or at least fast fwd to parts of a show without having to watch the ads, then get kicked back to a random spot in the video where there are more ads. Otherwise ok."
Tonya Walls,One of my favorite channels with my favorite shows Thank you!!
Aaron Bailey,Love the content on app . Hate that you have to jump through hoops to get it to play most of the time
anel Burrow,So many bugs on the mobile app and TV

James Zastrow,Works as described and great content
Rogelio Arguelles,"why I can't open it the app is just black and freezer, why I can have in my Samsung. I pay and doesn't work ."

Kev Ortiz,Won't let me watch sports and it always closes down
Vinny Giacinto,This app sucks...never loads properly
Nik Layman,App won't load past the logo screen for over a month now
Leopold Jung,App refuses to open on galaxy 23 plus. Just pure trash
Egbert Gentle,"Working perfectly for the champions league, wsl and every thing football."
Bryant Burnett,"The plan I purchased claimed ""no advertisements"", but every show I watch begins with an advertisement. Blatant False Advertising! Response: I have never watched any live TV on the platform. There is an advertisement literally every time I start playing an episode of anything."
Cherelyn Blasy,I love the programming and so far I'm liking the app. Was being a little glitchy on my older laptop. Working great on my tablet
Todd Peterson,Shows and movies are great. Sometimes slow or stopped at the start of a video. Bug mostly great.
Mark Deem,Excellent entertainment value.
Georgy Serga,Could you please fix full screen view for live events? It's been months in the broken state.
Charles Rishel,"Can't use the app, I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times when the app loads you get a blue screen with the animated Paramount Plus logo and then the screen just stays blue with the logo it never changes. Looks like I'll have to cancel my subscription. I have the same problem the other people are complaining about with the startup, and reading the replies suggesting they go the Paramount for help when you can't even get a live person to help you I'd rather cancel my subscription"
N A,"WORST STREAMING APP EVER! IT CHARGES WITHOUT WARNING EVEN PAST CANCELLATION. P.s I've contacted them DOZENS of times, they either don't answer to deflect the situation. WORST STREAMING APP EVERRR i am TELLING YOU do not at any point sign up with them. I would give them 0 stars if i could."
Massimiliano Wax,Very good. Needs a lot of bandwidth
Ann-Marie Lucas,"Worst streaming service that I have. If 90% of your reviews state there is a problem then you should probably fix the problem. The only service I have that crashes mid show, won't load and if I have to watch the black screen with twirling arrow one more time! Fix your app!"
FRELA Aldridge,Never using again never
Arturo Mancera,"App on my phone is horrible. While viewing content, I can't rotate my phone for full size viewing. Screen goes dark. Also randomly crashes and resets. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail."
brian dines,Works well
Carissa Thelander,"Loses our place, skips back after ads. Completely doesn't work on the Kindle app. Wish we could watch these elsewhere."
Jeremy Dobson,"So awesome that the ads are 2-3x louder then what your watching. app for tv (Sony) not so great, reinstall a lot just to get shows to actually play and not force close."
Susan Perry,Good clear picture and great choices!
Handy Wijaya,"Brightness is an issue when streaming through via phone app. Even with adaptive brightness, power saving off, and brightness at full max video played will turn dim. Good luck trying to maneuver through their website to voice your concern."
Debbie Smith,LUV IT!!!!!
Willie Benally,"Paramount so good and I missed the TV Shows day before then rewatched later,it great!"
Terra Johnson,Love the app!
Dino Anonym,Nice

Ciji Salazar,The app doesn't want to open up and I'm paying monthly I can't even watch my shows
Joe Rossi,I can't stream anything and they can't fix it. I pay on time every month and still get charged for it and I CANT STREAM ANYTHING üòí
Shaun Lewis,This app continues to crash.
Jenna Sharp,Garbage!! I used to love this app but for the last 4+ months I've been having issues with it constantly signing me out. Then when I sign back in it asks me to renew my subscription. But when I try to do that it says that I already have a subscription and to sign in. I haven't been able to watch the app at all for the last 2 of those 4 months due to this. I have canceled my subscription several times as well and it some how continues to resubscribe me each month. I want ALL 4 months refunded.
Louis E.,App won't go past the start up screen. Stick on the Paramount logo.
Renitta Powell,Awsome plays everywhere doesn't have a lot of c ommercials great for older shows üëç
Kari Gorczyca,Loved the app until a couple days ago when audio description is on on certain things. Can't watch anything with it on. Please help shut this off. Corrected the issue I believe.
Fran,Love this app
Derek Knowlton,Great but you have add all the transformers
Douglas MacKay,"Great app ,another of great movies and shows. Definitely recommend to others!"
chris hemmer,"Slow, I was actually trying to hit the pause button, and I kept getting a buffering wheel when the suggestion to rate came up. When I can't even pause because it has to buffer, you get two stars. Say what you want about Netflix but there app works. It loads quick, every button works, and even loads pretty well when you are in a spot with bad data. Paramount you have good programs but bad programming."
Kristin Carla Sherman Cantrell,Kristin Sherman Cantrell be my best friend of mine and go out with you guys in the living place now in the hospital and go to be home with you my dear SONG to your birthday and you can see the young man who is on my own life to sleep and enjoy the rest of my family and my sister and is Kristin with her life and she will be back in the world of God you will never receive my profit immediately you receive my money from the same place as you are coming home from Eagle to the fireworks in my names y

Roy Carrillo,Paramount is a great app to watch movies and read
Maddie Taylor-Nobles,I like the app a lot!
Grant Nagatori,Love it
Izaiah Johnson,Awesome app
Raul Benchocron,"The only thing I dislike about this app is that when you hit back by mistake and gets out of the playback, when you hit play again immediately it doesn't continue where you were. It seems that it doesn't immediately save the last playback point in the episode or movie that you're watching, and that is annoying. Fix that and it will be an excellent app."
Dee Jay,"Not also I'm mad that they canceled iCarly after the cliffhanger of all cliffhangers; But anytime I'm in a country where Paramount+ is Available... I ALWAYS get technical difficulties. Has happened in Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, UK, and even Switzerland. Never fails! The only thing I can think of is that any ip addy besides my home, it won't except or something. ü§î"
Christopher Holmes,App can't hide the navigation bar on Samsung phones. The bug has been persistent since launch. How am I supposed to enjoy a show or movie on my phone when an app cannot properly full screen it's content. Every other major streaming app has figured it out...pathetic.
tyler tangen,"Would love to rate it higher however using my s23 ultra with navigation buttons (don't like swipe gestures) it doesn't auto hide as it does in nearly every other app Netflix, Hulu, Disney, Max etc... it's frustrating when watching a movie I see that and there is no way to hide it like every other platform does. Update: 4 months later still doesn't auto hide like every other one does I tried to use contact us but only thing I can do is call"
Nick Melton,Great app has no bugs no kicking you out while watching üëçüèæ
TweenerJeenerGunner,"I've been watching season 5 of Star Trek Discovery. At the end of every episode I have to sit through four ads just to get to the credits. On every other service I use (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Peacock), it has a button that immediately shows up to watch the next episode. Rather than wait through four ads, I decide to exit the show and click on the next episode. However for some reason, Paramount+ sends me back to Season 1."
Burlene Vick Rex,Great app
holly nillo,"Great on a phone app, terrible on TV. Regardless if you update the app, have great internet. This still freezes and lags."
Fred Redick,Excellent job
Syscrash101,"Horrible Android app drops shows with full wifi connections. Not worth the headache. If there were a zero star option, I would have used it."
Piotr ≈ölata≈Ça,"No 5.1 sound via Chromecast nor in the Windows app. Update a year later, still no surround in Xbox nor the Chromecast"
myebonycam,Videos constantly don't work or play. Very annoying to uninstall constantly.
Luis Guzman,Very convenient
Michael Frick,"I love the shows, but I'm annoyed at having to still see ads for other shows, seeing as I pay NOT to see ads at all. Very disappointing."
Joella,Really enjoy watching this app they have great movies on Paramount Plus
Mr Young,Would be much better if I could watch the things I'm interested in without glitches every time a device is turned on... lots of problems. Hope they get resolved
krishnarohith donepudi,App doesn't work it very slow half of the time it will load.
ANDRE KITTS,Need live streaming
Gloria Raspberry,With no TV have to keep up with my programs.
Melissa Park,Love the variety of shows to choose from. (Hate the commercials)
William Connally,"This app is trash and has been for a long time. With 1000,s of negative reviews you would think they would fix it. It's just the same 2 different responses to every review"
Tonya Brooks,"Great app with great movie choices. And also , very inexpensive . LOVE IT !!"
Judy Crawley,Best deal ever
Jacob Favre,"Absolutely ZERO cancelation option, gonna have to dispute charges next cycle. Won't let me log into web browser and there are zero cancelation options anywhere. I'm never signing up again"
Linda Ray,"Unhappy that I can't watch on TV. I Can't afford to go buy a TV just to watch CB. A lot of the stations are just smut. I think the ""+"" in the name releases them from network standards."
Desiderio Tudon,Awesome
Norman Jordan,Excellent
Juan di bella,"TV app rarely works, and the user friendliness of the app is awful. Good shows, but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble. Maybe it's better off to watch on other platforms."
Phyllis Davis,Will not stay on. Keep getting message saying this video is no available. I pay a monthly fee and watch a weeks worth of shows.
Scott Benton,"So much better. The app is finally playing properly, consistently, and quickly. Good job making it work well."
Debbie Walton,This is a terrible app and you can't cancel this easily.
Harold Young II,Long ads before show on paid app. No way to remove a series it automatically added.
Daryl Roberts,Paramount Plus
Kyle Ma,Screen is too dim and often flickers between a even more dim screen randomly. Please update app so that screen brightness can be adjusted. Also sometimes audio track self plays a visually impaired track. Changing between all audio versions in settings does not fix the issue. Forced to watch show with narrator describing scene. Tech support suggestion to clear cache and restart phone/app did not fix issue. Works better on my iPad but terrible on Android. Please fix app
ALLOVE WISER,"It would be better if the sections of 60 minutes were divided up, with easy access to each individual program every Sunday on 60 minutes."
Myra Jay,Terrible app won't let you cancel subscription.
Holly Green,Great shows and movies!! Definitely worth the price!!
Maggie Giamalvo,"I don't know what's going on, but I've updated the app on my phone and tablet but neither is working. Usually, this is one of my favorite apps, just not right now. ETA: I'm not a moron. There's a bug in your app. Fix it."
Steve Schilling,Love it! Better than Hulu or Netflix!
E.T. Saffon,"Nothing but commercials. If you enjoy watching tons of mandatory commercials every 7-10 minutes, this is the app/subscription for you! It sucks. Complete rip off. Too many commercials. Won't renew."
Beaver Burps,"Ads in premium that I cannot skip. This is ridiculous Edit: per the devs response, there are still ads you cannot skip in premium, which is the issue I stated."
Christie Smith,I love paramount has awesome movies shows etc.
Azurite Coast,"Incredibly buggy. The app will stop working most of the time, sometimes only functioning if I open the Currently Watching but errors out on every other episode. The error codes don't work, and despite clearing my cache, files, and reinstalling, this app won't work even on a flagship Android phone. This isn't to mention the annoying unskippable bumpers and ads for other shows."
manuel guevara,Still waiting for yall to bring back NCIS: Los Angeles for current account holders.
betty coots,App freezes a lot
Elle Robert,"Can't cancel 7 day Free trial, Soooo Paramount Subscription is going to make me pay for MAY My 7 Day Free trial IS FINISHED on The 7th day, tomorrow will be 7 days So They don't Care and are going to make me pay for paramount account I hate it"
Lynette McPherson,Love the selection.
T. Encalade,"The app won't even open. Can't sign in, can't set up the subscription, can't watch the show I was trying subscribe to get to....app just doesn't work. So why offer it to download?"
Mario Monterrosa,"Awful app experience no matter what device I use. It's awful on my phone, TV, and tablet. I am unable to view any video in full screen it crashes the app."
minecraft education edition,Perfect I'm so glad that this is a thing now I can watch avatar the last airbender
Natica Strong,Get streaming app for a reasonable price.
Evan L,"Sorry, this video is currently unavailable. Please try again.."
T. Gonz,Errors all the time. THIS IS THE WORST STREAMING APP.
A,"I PAY FOR NO ADS! I GET ADS! I cut cable to get away from commercials, and yet I still get them. I'm going to cancel Paramount+. Edit. Update to the comment left by CBS Interactive. So if I pay for Paramount+ with Showtime, you're telling me I'll STILL see an ad/preview before movies and shows?? This is ridiculous, if a someone pays for the option to not see ads or commercials/previews....THEY SHOULDN'T SEE THEM AT ALL!! This is a huge money grab. I'm still canceling Paramount+."
Donavan Smith,Great shows new and old
Jason Kuretski,The app doesn't work for live events at least 30% of the time. Doesn't matter how many times I clear it's cache or reset it. I pay for the subscription out of convenience but if I have to find streaming elsewhere for live tv this often it really makes me question if the app is even worth the 3 dollars a month I pay.
Daniel Sarioglu,"I don't usually write app reviews, but this one is so frustrating that I had to. The app sucks. It crashes every time I try to go to full screen. As someone watching football games, it's unwatchable unless it's full screen."
Valeria Cruz,Never even opened
Nick,"Some ok stuff to watch but they force unskippable ads (yes, sometimes more than one) for other shows on the service before playing the thing you want. Not cool when I am paying a premium price for the service and capable of browsing and deciding for myself. *EDIT: I don't watch live tv, but the preview ads that run before ""on-demand"" content aren't totally unskippable, I found you have to back out to the menu and select your show again to bypass them. It's still annoying and my rating stands."
Me Notu,"At first it seemed to have a problem with password reset but it seems to have fixed it and Dev was quick to help in comments, ty"
Crystal Rafferty,Love it
Picky Jim,Very glitchy. Buffers repeatedly even with very fast internet. Performance varies between smart tv platforms--LG seems the worst. Can cast from a smartphone to the LG and get better performance than using app directly on the LG. Runs better on Samsung TVs but still get buffering issue. Cycling power and unplugging TV helps but glitchy performance comes back eventually. Searching in a show for a specific scene is poorly designed and it too is very glitchy; hard to control speed & step thru scenes
James McGilley,Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus 5G android 14 UI 6.1. My previous issue was resolved
Patty Allen,"On my Samsung, many times,the paramount screen never switches to users. On my TV, it glitches, and I end up turning it off."
The Pro-Wrestling Encyclopedia,One of my FAVORITE Steaming Apps to use! Use it more than any of the others I have! $11.99 NO ADS AT ALL!!! I absolutely hate ads which is why I stream!
Chris Kinkade,"Update April 2024: same as before, constant errors slow to load. Won't play media if a Bluetooth device is connected on Pixel 8 (new bug as of early April 2024)"
Patricia Steers,Was working great but it always freezes.
Sharon Adams,I love this app! All my favorite shows old and new.
Yasmin,Update: we already cancelled our subscription to get something better i don't like spending my hard earned money on apps that lag and got too many issues App not letting me log in once I got a new phone and I'm using the right password because I have it written so what the heck is going on with the app?
Whatsit Toya,"Good shows and the ads aren't too bad, but what the hell is up with it skipping the last third of the episode on my TV? And not being able to skip to the right moment is just plain stupid. Figure it out. Giving more stars for fast reply. I'll look into it.."
Santino Deluca,"loving the free trial, watching the godfather moviesüôèüôè"
James Shelly,"Now, not only do we have to pay our subscription, but now we have to watch 5 minutes of commercials to be able to watch anything. Shame on you Paramount plus, how much more greedy are you going to get"
Matt Anderson,"No option available to go to a standard definition or low quality to save on Mobile Hotspot data for a laptop or TV. Every other streaming service offers this except Paramount+. All video streamed on a laptop, desktop, or TV is HD or HIGHER depending on the quality of the connection. Pretty ridiculous Paramount Plus doesn't offer an option to save data."
bill shumsky,I love the many things to watch.
Z He,This app at the beginning feels somewhat user unfriendly It forces you even if you don't like the movies To pick 3 at the beginning They also play ADS Even though you're paying Monthly for it ü´†
Ronald McClung,"Why IS this? No memory have I of doing this here, moving phone under it. No. PAY here this thing to you? When we were still much younger, 35 cents to go watch movie all day. Only ends of week. Was no Internet long before Al Gore said he invented it. Did LBJ pay Secret Agent Man to get JFK out of his way? Let's go, Brandon. Before Time Tunnel. Star Trek was new, 1st time tv. Paramount had Cinemascope movies in Technicolor. Who knew? You buy leechee nut? Gimme $5, GI."
Gary White,This is a great app. I love it.
Sabraney Davis,Sometimes the app kicks ypu off the screen just goes back
Marsha Merrell,Trying to cancel my Paramount + subscription... to no avail. The App is great! My BFF and I are upgrading together. So I no longer need this app!
Crystal Moore,Great App
Kevin Knox,Does what it's supposed to do and has a decent library of content. (Any & all IPs & films & TV shows that are owned by Paramount Global ‚Äî formerly known as ViacomCBS).
Rusty Dotson,Great app
Joseph Salama,Great use of available series.
darthspader,Please add the ability to skip to next episode from the current episode. Why does the app have to ask me to rate it over and over and over...... even after I have given a rating!!!!! Please turn that off!!!!!!
jacquelynn smith,"Took some time, but got it started on my Roku."
James Nelson,Worst app developer ever. I could easily have a mental patient make this better to navigate than the way it currently is. Just look at the download section. A-z only no way to sort or God forbid filter. Everything else is the &;@()-@ same. Sorry @$$ app. Buuut I do like paramount. Buuuut this app is the worst thing since communism.
Leelah Leelah,Why am I paying 11 dollars plus tax and still seeing commercials üòê
Daisy Garcia,App doesn't work on my TV. It's always has errors. Have not been able to stream at all on my TV. Not even after uninstalling and reinstalling it. Reached out to customer service and they have not helped me with the issue at all. Horrible and ignorant customer service. It's a shame.
Destiny Estrada,Me and my son love this app. Can watch what I want and so can he on his own profile.
Liquid Harbor,"Sometimes there is streaming issues sometimes there is not. I wrote up Busta Rhymes, Ciara and Missy Elliot for False Advertising. Also The Martinez Brothers have been reported for Rico Racketeering and are not eligible for re-entry as they are Excommunicated from Tribal."
Cherie Smith,Movies is shipping all through the movie
David Leyson,"Excellent content, but app freezes on Fire TV. Runs great on Android."
LINDELL TOLLSTRUP,PARAMOUNT LOGO COMES ON AND THAT'S IT. I'AM NOT PAYING FOR THIS. NOTHING TO RATE. - 3 IS BEING GENEROUS.
Chris Lindsey,A great selction of options!
Tanya Dixon,Excellent
Stephany Lewis,"This is the worst streaming app for any device. It cuts off mid episode/movie with an error code all the time. TV, phone, tablet...IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S THE WORST. AND YES... THEY'RE ALL UPDATED."
Lew Germany,Paramount is actually one of the best streaming sites for the price.
Phil Deeds,The overlay for my S22 won't go away after selecting content. This leaves about a quarter of an inch of my screen black. It's really annoying.
John Goulart,A better value than its major competitor.
Count Jonny Sculls,"It's a surprisingly easy streaming service to navigate. These days, so many streaming services that have a massive library of content can often times be somewhat difficult to navigate through and find exactly what you're looking for. Paramount+ seems to have simplified and, at the same time, streamlined that issue. Really digging this platform."
Christopher L. Scott S.R.,Ok
ethan l,"Literally useless. I installed it and it says ""This app is no longer supported."" I'm running this on a Galaxy Z Fold 3 on the latest version of Android. What does it want me to do? Run it on an NSA supercomputer? Easily the worst streaming app on the face of the planet"
DeAndre Henderson,Can't open after recent update.
Mario E. Martinez,Not opening at all
Frank Salvatore,This app has everything from classics to new releases and tv shows from cbs to nickelodeon.
Ray Trujillo,It's nice.
Jericho Brown,Slow running
Annette Beam,"LOVE Watching the shows I want, when I want"
Ryan Moore,"Freezes and lags constantly even on wifi, only upside is it's not as bad as the completely unusable PS4 app. Correction, the Samsung Smart TV app is worse than all of them, how is it possible to have an app this poorly made?"
Sean Lingo,Terrible app. Always freezing and glitching and forces me to watch ads when on my phone.
Richard Gomez,The Best
Spencer Grenfell,For all the money you spend you would assume they would have a working app. Constant black screen with audio and no video. oh and if you do cast good luck getting the visual impaired audio descriptions off (you can't). Asking for help is even more frustrating.
Kisha Taylor,Great !
Ivan Lopez,Best clip of the dayy
SaXx,"This app freezes, crashes, spins but doesn't play (I mean it will eventually but...) so annoying."
Brian Miller,Works great on my phone.
Vikrant Srivastava,Sucks! Keeps playing Ads over and over.
Chris H.,"I didn't think it possible that they made the app even worse. Now I can't stream past a commercial when it freezes completely. I uninstalled and reinstalled, I cleaned the cache and nothing. Shame because they have good content. I don't seem to be alone in having problems, but the developers don't seem to care. Now I know why streaming services lose money - lousy apps. FYI - I know the basic fixes, but there are enough similar complaints that the problem is with the app and not the user."
andres grajales,Always great
CARYBORDERSHART,9/10 times it opens to a black screen
Michael Iriarte,great service no lag on streaming!!
James Miller,Amazing changed my life
Tonya Rockey,All of my favorite shows are on! It's great!
Brett Edelman,"I've had a paramount plus subscription for over a year and use it on several different devices. The shows are very quiet. I have to crank the sound up to hear the show. Then the ads come on, which are extremely loud, and I have to mute it. This has been going on for MONTHS with no fix other than to ""upgrade to premium."" I will not be giving them more money and I warn everyone I talk to. Not worth it."
Mikaila Thomas,Why are downloads so large? I downloaded 1 movie to watch on a flight and it took up almost 20gb while I have movies and entire seasons of shows from Netflix that take up less than 3gb combined
Melrose276,"It's very slow most times and glitches, but so far, it isn't so bad since I have my favorite shows on this platform."
Nathan Waggoner,Needs some new material but overall I like it.
Love Music,This app is hacked
Brett Hunsinger,Why am I paying for a subscription that I can't use bc the app keeps freezing while I'm watching shows and just restarts itself watching on a LG smart TV
Jay R,Star Trek and my local
Andy Stout,"MORE LOWER DECKS! Also this app is trash. They got greedy with too many commercials, now the app doesn't play shows right or at all in some cases. Not sure why this app even cost money now."
Bonnie Jensen,"Decent selection but the thing that's really really aggravating is that I can't edit my ""continue watching"" section. If I decide I don't want to watch all of a movie, I'd like to be able to not finish it, and not have it keep popping up every time I open the app. Literally every other streaming app has this option."
john M,"Over priced, poor working app."
Gladys Felton,Have enjoyed watching shows and movies viewed to date. I have not had any technical issues or anything that would have impeded using this app. I am satisfied with it.
Darrin Tito35,Love it
Aaron Mullendore,Tulsa King!!!
Nichole Wallace,"Good shows, horrible app! It is very persistent about you watching ALL of the ads, even the one at the very end of the show. You can't switch to the next episode unless you either watch the credits and the ad at the end of the credits or scroll through every single season to get to the current one and click on the next episode. Ads freeze. If you stop too soon into an episode, it will switch you back to the previous one so you can watch more ads!"
Bonnie Dodge,Beautiful I love it and I get it with my straight talk $55 monthly service also Walmart Plus
Beverly Fleischer,I cannot watch no movies and I'm signed in. I did the update too.
Jeff,"Ads and more ads. Even if you pay the upgraded price, they still show you ads. Dropped subscription and never coming back."
Mike,Great
LadyGinaBelle,Works great! Supports picture-in-picture. I've been on the app since downloading almost every day and I haven't had any issues.
jordan anderson,I want to cancel my subscription and it tells me to cancel through Google play store and there is no option in the play store so I have been paying for an app that I never use and I can not cancel
Michael Roberts,I like üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ
reree,paramount+ is such a good money investment.
Coen Slate,"The app just doesn't open on android anymore. With latest update on both Android and the app itself. Simply will not go past the first brand splash when opening the app. Complete garbage, and even before when it did work, the UI was terrible and laggy. If I could rate lower than 1 I would, I don't understand how an app can get worse over time, at least it used to actually work. Sad."
Tabitha Shearer,Absolutely love
Jessica Smith,Great price for the selection. Love the live TV options too!
Coryse and khaden villarouel,Nice and convenient to watch my favorite programming
Cameron Scott,"On top of unskippable ads seemingly placed with the intention of disrupting the show and killing any drama or tension in those scenes, they're now cutting the few series I was keeping the app to watch. No reason to keep it after the last season of lower decks is released. We have everything else on blu ray or dvds so not really sure why these leeches think they deserve almost 200 a year from us all."
Jamie Weiss,Love it
Randall Banfield,"The app won't open, I have to go through an e-mail sent to me in order to watch paramount +. You sent an update, but it still won't open. Maybe it's an android issue."
Nick,"Why do I have to sign up to social media to reach out. Why can't I contact support directly? Give me a number, email, and address or I'll consider this a third refusal"
Ana Yepez,Best shows and movies
Scott Morgan,Keep saying it's having technical difficulties and doesn't work.
Katelind,Only subscribe if you absolutely love it bc canceling is impossible. They make it so hard to cancel that there are listing of different ways to cancel and none of them work.
Sharolyn Wells,Paramount+ has all my favorite shows on it.
Oscar Urenda,Great selection and options for the kids. A lot of good shows and movies for adults. Very good selection of old and new movies and shows.
Rodney Bradshaw,Nice shows
Jerry Raines,Has all my favorite shows and I love it
Infrasoul,The worst streaming app. Navigation bar is always in your face.
Edward Ogletree,I love this app
Nicolas Dunigan,Paramount network is the best thing ever
itali itali,Best app for movie
horace Duhon,Great
John,"The only thing I don't like about the app & it may be just on my phone model. Is that my phone home buttons don't disappear when watching something. Other than that, I have no issues with the app and it works well."
Reveca Ruvalcaba,"It's great but to many error pop-ups,"
Ashton Stennett,"definitely a nice switch from Netflix! paramount has such a solid line up that I couldn't imagine watching all of these, and I'm only talking the movies and shows that interest me! super solid App interface as well! awesome for at the airport thank you!! such a critical amenity that I couldn't imagine that it took me so long to download"
Aubrey Mace,The amount of ads is annoying but overall I enjoy the app
Melinda Sherman,I am really enjoying Paramount+. They have a great selection and some of the top rated movies and TV shows. I never have trouble with the app and it's an affordable option for good programming.
Brad,Ok
Jennifer Jepson,Can't sign in
Mr K (Nob),"Paramount plus won't let me download episodes. It says i need a wifi connection. I don't use wifi, and there isn't an option to toggle this feature on and off. What the hell..."
Nan Larkin,"I'm in the same boat as everyone else. For a year now, I have reached out to the help option. I have no issues with my internet, but they insist that it is the problem. No other streaming service gives me trouble, and I have many. I have multiple times, followed all of their recommendations, but let's face it. This app is terrible. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the great selection of shows. I'd love to change it to 5 stars if they would fix all of the bugs."
Game Hunter,Just because you decided to run news at the middle of the end of the Billy Joel concert you ruined a beautiful concert
Michael Thorn,nice
Bass Player,PARAMOUNT IS THE BEST. GREAT SHOWS AND VERY REASONABLE PRICE.
Karem Gh,"Honestly, just quit and give to Netflix or Hulu or Amazon. It's buggy, slow, makes you wanna vomit. We like your shows, your app makes us sick"
Froggy Frogg√©,Hard to pay bill keep getting run around
Paul Roberts,Easily the worst performing streaming app I use.
Chad Vargo,"This app sucks! Always crashes. Even when hardwired into a 1Gig download speed. And their troubleshooting page is garbage also. Fix the app, fix the buffering, and prevent the constant crashing. We should get refunds for how bad the app has been lately"
cconnelly1,Signed up for a free trial today on my Android phone. Want to cancel now. Have followed every instruction I can find anywhere and there is no apparent way to do this. I have tried for 2 hours.
Suzie Elie,A one
Brent,worst streaming platform I've ever used. the lag is unbelievable
diane Barfield,Streaming was horrible
Juiceman713,Too much ads
Hana Assefa,Awesome!
Cindy Supersad,Signed up today and can't even get into the app
Herlan Westra,App crashes frequently on Fire TV. Many videos cannot be retrieved without crashing.
Regina Farley,WHERE IS JAG complete season 8??????Want to watch ncis pilot episodes season 8 episode 20 and 21.
Susan Milovich,"Could not access what I got the app for, very difficult to navigate."
Richard Lopez,Terrible
denny lopez,Everything I love and more.
Brent Clarke,Good shows and ap works well
Frank Castle,Won't work if you block ad tracking attempts. No good content and the UI is embarrassing for such a large company.
Paul B,"Sick of the bs.. I've had Paramount plus since before it became Paramount plus and it was CBS. Every damn time I turn around there's some other issue with it. I pay for ad-free and I still get ads. I've tried watching ""Why Women Kill"" on my TV and it locks up my TV. I can watch some of the other shows. But for some reason that one doesn't want to play. Customer service don't help. I can see my other reviews that Samsung TVs tend to have issues like I do and they have not fixed it yet."
Johnny Stricklin,Great app!
Justin Taylor,Love video
Kelly,HORRIBLE app enough said
Alex Evans,I get this service for free with walmart+ subscription and I'm thinking it is still overpriced!!
C D Cadogan,There doesn't seem to be any way to link my Walmart account. I've cleared the cache and reinstalled the app 4 times now. Off to complain to Walmart...
NORBERTO LOPEZ-RIVERA,very good app reliable
Jay22,Some movies coast money
Cally,Too many commercials....I didn't know there was a commercial free version. Thank you.
Gloria Goree,"Video issues. For weeks, I couldn't watch anything on the app. The video wouldn't load, and it continued to say video playback issue."
Shuntel Duncan,It's great.
David Dauntless,"I tried to get this app to work with my t-mobile account but it won't.The only premium app that does,instantly connected with t-mobile was pandora premium."
Bxndjdndndn Ndnxnxjx,Very poor app keeps freezing up
Melissa Hibbert,I love this app the best programming looks so good crisp clean very nice
Dad Glass,"I'm still mad about all the realignments. Paramount is Paramount. This has gotten way better, i knew Paramount( believed it ). Thanks Edit3d Again: I cant say how much I üòç Paramount. Its the only thing I Stream. I dont need anything else. Again Paramount is Paramount!!! Edited 4: idea. With cable companies internet is almost, just on itself, damn near as expensive as the package deals, In my opinion, yes content cost money, dont do a money grab, try to find a way to balance it."
C. Okpala,Paramount should be ashamed of this garbage app. Such a big studio and in over two years using it they have done nothing to fix this trash that we pay for... nonstop glitches on anything you watch.
John Green,"This is the WORST streaming app by far! It constantly crashes. It will let you download episodes, if you can keep it from crashing, but will not allow you to watch those episodes unless you are connected to internet. What's the point of downloading episodes if you have to be connected anyway?!? This app is worthless!!"
Laura Hyllested,Love my app
Robert Jones,It's really something else üò≥ ok
chuck,"Great app, easy to use, tons of movies, shows, selections live events. Worth every penny!"
Bridget ouarara,It doesn't matter what type of subscription you have with this channel paramount. They have got the worst service I have ever seen in my life. It's been two weeks since I've been able to see a program because they have technical difficulties. They don't have a problem taking your money when they want it but they sure have issues when it comes to see anything on their stations. I am really disgusted with paramount. They need to pay everybody back. The video playback is terrible
Pat Army,Awesome üëå üëèüèº
Rich Moreno,üëçüèºüôåüèΩ
Dor G,"Brightness keeps intermittently dimming and brightening. It is not my phone screen settings but something in the app when watching any video. Also, sometimes it just doesn't load. Very buggy app."
Damion Hibbert,Love it
Steve Jorgenson,Terrible app. This is the only streaming app I use that's constantly glitching. Insufferable viewing experience
Edward Jones,Lovely thanks I'm very excited about this y
Matthew Demetrakis,Fun
alicia manzanilla,"I love the shows and movies on the app, I just don't give it 5 stars because I would like to have the option for subtitles in other languages, so that the content is accessible to more people, like other apps have."
TAB,"warning, if you open an account it will not allow you to cancel. ive been trying cancel my account for 3 months and just keep getting chatged.."
Jamacia Rudolph,Nothing but love
Jill Wiley,Yall are begging me to rate it so here ya go. I pay to much damn money for this app for it to be this bad every single day 24/7 365. Doesn't matter what I'm connected to...absolutely ridiculous
dovie coleman,Love Paramount
J- bird,"Experience is okay not that bad, not that good."
J.R.,"App is fairly trash. Runs slow, doesn't flip screen layout, crashes often. Content is good, but the overall Paramount plus suite (apple, online, android apps, smart tv apps, etc) need to be overhauled."
Sissy Ricketts,"Update April 2024: I'm still enjoying this app without any problems. I've had no problems with the app for over a year (2019). If it is acting weird, it usually needs updating. The only time the full price customers are getting commercials, etc.. is if they are logged out. And, yes, Criminal Minds is in the app."
Steve Cahall,Downloaded content consistently will not play without an internet connection (like on a plane). The point of downloading is to watch when there's no internet connection.
Amanda Riley,I love having access to all of my favorite shows. Every where I have an account I can watch them no matter where I'm at.
Pablo Torres,"Past week keeps saying technical problems. I tried uninstalling it and re-installing it, but same issue continues to happen."
Bob M.,Great place to watch almost anything.
Audrey Gillis,Great for watching movies easy access to what to watch. Save movies.
eric juniel,Great experience
Wilna Dancy,Love this app and all the amazing options
Making Changes,Everyone you need
Timothy Pike,Sub-par. The app crashes every 10 minutes while trying to watch a show. Continously loads and takes forever to start.
Freddy Wayne,"You guys have a bug in this app. After launching the app, (when smartphone is in Landscape View), it just locks up and stay at the logo splash screen but, (when smartphone is in Portrait View) the app loads completely."
Sara Starling,love it üò∫üò∫üò∫
WILSON WALES,"Every time I open it, the screen shows error there are technical problems"
A B,Enjoying the movies
Laley Baugh,Skips episodes and forwards through automatically..
Yo Yo,I have this app on 3 devices....by far the worst streamer
Aaron Lachiondo,"I week trial .... subscribe, ""payment declined"" also like they are trying to take money out of the account...that's so weird...and sketchy on their part. I'll stick with my other services."
Tanner Bridwell,Very nice
Douglas Gee,"Application crashes a lot on multiple platforms, Android and on Fire TV."
Nicholas Clark,This is a trash app from a trash company that doesn't bother to make it viewable and makes it virtually impossible to unsubscribe
Luke Ludlow,"This is hands down the most bug plagued app I've ever used. Great content, TERRIBLE execution!"
Felipe Ramos,A lot of good content here
Mr P,"As other reviewers mention: can't watch offline because can't login when offline; buggy to start episodes, or fwd/rev; clunky UI. Less mentioned: downloaded episodes and movies are deleted randomly, especially when remaining offline after closing app; also SELLS personal & private potentially compromising data to 3rd parties (data brokering and mining). Highest tier paid subscription. This app is a FAILURE of a streaming app. I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
Britney Thompson,I have had this app for quite some time. Before they switched to Paramount Plus. It was much better before they switched to Paramount plus now it crashes a lot. I have it on my Smart TV and it's the absolute worst app I have ever used! It takes forever to load and it just shuts off randomly. I also tried to watch local news the other day and I can no longer watch WCCO news in Minnesota. I miss having just regular CBS. Not to mention that I PAY to Have commercial free but yet they slip in ads.
Ashley Hunter,Constantly won't even start saying app isn't responding
Thomas Darnell,Plenty to watch
James howell,Alot of dragging while watching a movie
Autumn Murray,"This app and website does not allow you to update information. It will tell you to go to a site, where if you touch the link, does nothing, or if you go to the website will not allow you to log in or anything else. It says to finish registration and gives a submit button that does nothing."
chris Scholl,The tv version of this app is 100% trash. Constantly freezing. Even with different internet providers and a tv upgrade
D Demon,"Bout to cancel my prescription...every other app ( Netflix, discovery plus, Hulu & Disney) will play with zero problems.. Paramount however plays sound with no video..only watch couple movies before it started happening..so far it's not worth it..movies are great if you can watch them."
richard Burke,"Only app on my tv that freezes during anything I watch , then kicks me off!!! FIX THIS !!! right now definitely not worth the money...again Only app that does this!!"
Marcus Dorsey,Love it
wallered,No help
Marcia Cooper,"Great nature shows! So far.. I joined today. But so far, so good. I really like this biologist. Looking for a very rare leopard in Zanzibar, and h3 found it on a Camara, and was üò≠ing. Very emotional. A brilliant biologist Worth the $4.99. !!"
S Lane,Terrible app and no way to delete my Paramount+ profile.
Lea Markum,Every time I try to stream on my fire TV I always have issues. It's b*llsh*t.
Kenneth Robertson (Robertsonsx7),"Won't even work. I keep getting a notification saying "" We are experiencing technical difficulties."" I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times, with no luck."
Elicia Orr,It's keeps skipping. I re-download and it's still skips
Chelby,"Can never watch a full movie, even an episode, without the app crashing, saying it's having technical difficulties."
Lance Sorensen,Difficult to operate
Kyle Engle,Love it cheap too
Susan Petersen,Love this!
Brian Ludlow,Most Excellent
Kisha Gaulden,I wish it worked better on my ps4. It glitches a lot
Raquel Welborn,Great shows. The app often falls short in returning you to the last episode you've watched. Thats extremely annoying because it won't even have an indication as to which one it was. Your only hope is to write down where you left off.
A M,Awesome
Zach Knight-King,"Worst experience I've had with any streaming app. Constant technical difficulties, random quitting, and constant buffering during live broadcasts. The worst way to watch live soccer. It's a shame that they have the rights to so many good international competitions."
adelynn torres,They have the best shows and movies
Do you smell that?,"Why is it, Every time I want to access my account through the app. It tells me to log in online and then when I go online. And the log in a click on the link and it sends me right back to the app. It's a vicious cycle of back-and-forth. And I can never log into my account So I can update my billing."
William Caswell,App constantly crashes while watching shows. For something I have to pay a considerable amount for I would expect it to perform flawlessly.
Tom Winton,Keeps asking for reviews
Magicstorm Frostfire,"Awful service. I put up with it for 3 years because its the only streaming app we can watch spongebob. Theres glitches, buffers, contsant uninstall/reinstalling for at least an hour before it will KINDA work. The recent update just absolutely will NOT work on any TV we have. I cant even cast from my phone to the TV anymore. Ive tried for a week. Ive reinstalled, tech support, turned it off/on, cleared cache/data. Canceling my subscription. Ill just pirate Spongebob for my sister if i have to."
Mouse Lil,"App sucks, drains phone, keeps glitching not worth the money."
Jamie Harrington,Awesome
Justin Simms,I just love all the war documentaries. Fascinating stuff. Good knowledge to have and important facts worth learning.
Rodrigo Guerrero,"I rate this app a 4 star because I bought it and it's worth it,the app has a lot of good movies and shows like Halo,scream vi you should get it although it costs üí∞ money"
Chris H (Vlenfius),App won't launch
Michelle Salazar,Always lagging and I can't get my laptop to sign in via Walmart app
L Sh,Always buffering
Coastie CL (Coastie98),Love it!
Jamie Garton,"I cannot watch on my phone. I'll get sound but no picture. Also, the app does not remember where you left off and often I have to go through episodes to find the last one I watched. Very frustrating!"
Jenica N Gregory,"So far, love it a LOT enjoying comedy Central... üëç"
William Munroe,Garbage app. Paramount just announced the cancellation of Star Trek: Lower Decks. This was one of the truest trek shows. This demonstrates the lack of commitment Paramount has on growing a show that has a following.
Ivan Rocha,awesome
Frank Kroger,Avoid
Richard Ruelas,Trying something new
Karen Smith,Have good. Direct answer and it was easy to follow
christie Banta,Hate watching commercials
James Culp,"STOP REPEATING THE SAME 2 ADS ON LOOP LIKE A BROKEN RECORD ""oH jUsT uPdAtE iT"" I DO NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED SPACE TO UPDATE."
Steven Graham,"Great shows, easy to use"
Neidra ‚ÄúNei‚Äù Pray,ü©µü©∂ü©µü©∂ I love this app.. I get 2 binge watch all my shows.. and catch up when I need to
mchmkr,Planning on cancelling once the final season of Lower Decks air. I'll go out of my way to torrent Paramount from here on out.
Dustin Allgood,Sucks when binge watching a show and the skip into only goes part way into the intro. Always have to manually skip ahead and sometimes confuses the app makes me start all over. 2nd rate streaming app
David Mendenall,Aside from being restricted from being able to enjoy the showtime paramount combo I am really enjoying the app... lots of movies to choose from.
patricia wakefield,Love the shows
J. Kriss White,"Horrible problems with Amazon FireTV,"
keith B,"It's been great the past couple yrs,but now it won't play half the shows I wanna watch and keep saying error. Then it just shuts it's self down and closes out. Not very happy at the moment with the app. Get it fixed. I'm adding to my previous review... This date is now 04/12/2024,it's gotten a little bit better but still lags, when I go to ""my list"" and review what I'm watching or looking for new episodes and go back to previous menu it goes back to very beginning of list. Still disappointed"
Justin&katlyn Fox,Not working
Summer Fox Belly,Movies I enjoy and some I can't find on other apps
Just John,I am totally disappointed with paramount! You see more commercials than the movie or series themselves. Not a fan anymore.
Chris Hallam,Glitchy as fuq. How many times do you have to watch the same ad over and over? .. and then restart what you are watching... just to watch ads again to continue where you left off.
Karim Lalji,Tried watching one love and ot keeps freezing. Everything else works. How can you not plan for the launch of a movie and have enough capacity to let your customers watch???
Suzanne Burden,App has been working beautifully! Love it!!!
John Ballard,"A little pricy. A lot that I'd never watch. Showtime stuff should be included instead of extra, or just make it ad supported with no fee."
C Dero,Part of me is upset they're canceling lower decks the other part is glad I can get rid of another streaming service after the last lower decks final season
Bob Anthony,"This app doesn't open when you click on it to open after downloading from the app store. Rather, it pops up with an error message :"" We are currently experiencing some technical difficulties. Please check again later. "" This has been ongoing for months now."
D√§ve L V√§len,"So, NOW the problem of an error # 6000 occurs in which on my tablet (Samsung Tab A) wont play nothing of the apps content. And also on my other devices the app constantly behaves with glitches. Horrible app and disappointing. I will not gonna re-subscribe."
Austin Russell,Love it alot..another...
S,"It's ok, sometimes slow, sometimes crashes, sometimes loses connection."
T,"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS APP!! I SEE I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON HAVING ISSUES WITH THIS APP. I READ OVER 55 REVIEWS ALL PRETTY MUCH STATING THE SAMETHING THAT THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY ISSUES WITH THIS APP AND PARAMOUNT JUST PUTS OUT A GENERIC TROUBLE SHOOTING SUGGESTION. This is the worst streaming app I have. On all of my devices, it either gives error messages or stops playing when a commercial starts. If I didn't already pay for the year upfront, I would cancel my subscription."
Ethan Richmond (Ethan Richmond Tablet),RokuTV
Syrisa,"Keeps saying it doesn't work on my phone anymore. Also, I'm not sure where to put this, but the version for the TV keeps freezing when watching a show or movie."
Debbie West,So far it is great
Ashley,Definitely could use more updated movies. Same selection for a long period of time. More movies I've never heard of then any other app I use combined. We just got this to view the Chiefs games. CHIEFS NATION!
Pete Romero,Excellent shows and movies
Tiffany Wade,"Always freezing on ads. I have updated, un-installed and reinstalled the app. Can't even get through 1 show."
Denise,"After going thru the troubleshooting, uninstalling and reinstalling several times the app still does not work right. It constantly buffers. Not happy paying monthly for a service that I can't use! I have other streaming apps with no problems. Still after months, I have lagging only with this streaming app. I kept it because some of my shows can only be viewed here. As soon as they are available elsewhere, I will cancel my subscription. Still takes an hour to get thru a 30 minute episode. Crazy"
Natasha Grapentin,"Difficult to manage account. Also, they removed Blues Clues and You. Very unhappy."
Herry Jooper,All the movies I like!
Steven Klecak,To many ads Not enough new content Might delete app.... if I wanted showtime I'd download that app.
Freedom,Horrible. Doesn't matter how strong the connection it either won't play or continuously stops.
Kyle Veenstra,I open up the app and the Paramount+ logo loads and then nothing happens. It's just the Paramount+ and that's it.
Dean Pitts,"The app is slightly unstable. While watching a video, the video screen will randomly minimize or close for no reason. This happens is a very few to a couple of minutes. There is no update available and I have already restarted my phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra)."
Saiya Shinta,Canceling because they canceled lower decks. The ONLY reason people got this is because of Star Trek and you keep either getting rid of it or canceling it
Tron,"Keeps crashing, no amount of trouble shooting can fix it. Definitely not going to waste my money on something that doesn't work."
Chris Floyd,"It kind of depends on what device you use it on, it does not work very well on my Google Chromecast devices, on PC and TV apps I'm not having any major problems."
Charles Woods,great
Rambo 999 (RamboFam999),Not able to even open the app it just stays on the paramount+ screen üòí
Bruce A Underwood,More HALO
amy watkins,"can't play on tv,been trying"
Melissa Pena,Love it
Brandi Garcia,I love this app but lately it has been crashing and shows flash it is getting very frustrating
Tracy Mickelson,"Terrible. There are always delays, audio issues and it takes forever to get something to load. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, used multiple devices and wi-fi's and it is always annoying to use."
Kimberly Burt,Why can't I delete old credit card numbers from my google payment accounts
Carrol Weathermon,"To mine commercials, but has some great programming.."
Christopher Consoli,"Some decent content, but the app itself is absolutely garbage. If watching a series and wanted to go back to an episode, it will return you to the logical starting point, which is, of course, two seconds before the credits automatically go to the following episode. Rewind skips whole minutes at a time and is sluggish to respond and seek doesn't work, so, very frustrating. Aside from a few classic shows and movies ,you should be able to watch everything worth seeing during the free week trial."
Simon Puta,"The programming with CBS is something worth the subscription, but when you look at the reviews and see how far back issues have been reported, you will find that there is not 1 subscriber who will say the issue was resolved. Its very disappointing service, as subscribers you have legitimate issues and instead are either dealt with an automated response sending you to an FAQ site with fixes that don't work. Let me simply put it it's not your internet nor devices. The common denominator is the APP"
Frances Koe,Perfect app
E Hill-Street,"Best ever!! Never had any problems on what ever device I'm watching it on TV, Tablet, Phone or Projector it's great! I've had this app for 3 years or more."
Jimmy Walter,"App constantly freezes and lags no matter what I'm using it on. And even when you pay for no ads, they still show you ads before you start a show."
Keith Birnie,I have about a dozen streaming services...the paramount app is by far the worst. Particularly on the fire stick..the buffering makes shows unwatchable. I think you should reach to the crew that was running the showtime app for some ideas on how to improve this less than optimal performing app.
Amanda Cora Walker,Love this app
Anthony Amato,"Doesn't work on my phone freezes at start animation. yet still has multiple trackers that do work per my tracking identifier app. Support is a bad joke. ""Try restarting your phone. Try uninstall then re install"" that's all with that. Also paid more for no ads but has stupid ads by paramount you are forced to watch before what you selected. Horrible controls and layouts for usability."
April Rocco,Love paramount plus been a subscriber for 2 years. I have seen and enjoyed multiple movies and shows. From new releases to old favorites. Subscribe now for the best.
TT C,"Updates arent fixing the issues! Everything plays way TOO Dark That's w/ my brightness @100%. Plus it fades in & out randomly. Nav bar at bottom stays Lit 24/7. 'Use old Showtime App instead for Par+' Great Layout, Full Info on Shows & Actually Worked. Pay 4 Ad Free w/Showtime but Ads Keep Showing! *Read other reviews/same buggy BS! Emailed support,they will not respond. Some current Series airing on TV atm arent even up to date, missing their recent seasons.*ShowtimeAnytime Back Pls!"
Cha tagg,Good
AZ's Legendary Videoz,"This app has excellent movies and tv shows. BUT the app does crash alot. I recommend that you fix this issue, that way you keep customers. I've also tried all the trouble shoot steps and I'm still having that issue. There are other customers that have the same crashing issue. It sounds like it might be an app bug. Or the software may need to be updated on your side. Please fix this issue. Because I'd like to continue to utilize Paramounts service.."
Donald Armenta,"I. love. This Series...Thanx... ! HAD TA' FINISH WATCHING THIS. EPISODE. IT TOOK ME 61 MINUTES PAST .MY. FREE TRIAL ...! NOT FAIR I. Have to. SUBSCRIBE‚Å¥ MONTHLY ONLY, ANYWAY !"
7up Dnl,I don't get the point of pictures in picture of it just blacks out all the shows.
Shannon Bethea,"I absolutely love my Paramount+ subscription. I get to watch CBS shows without commercials with my plan. It is an excellent streaming source, just 1 flaw...it will get stuck when trying to fast-forward or rewind occasionally. Other than that 1 flaw, it is amazing."
Lesbiana Hermafrodita,What makes me not want to be a customer is when they make it so difficult to cancel and can't change email address either. Otherwise they would get 3 stars. Down grade is the only option that's easy. I got it for southpark and there's not anymore new episodes. And I got it for boxing and there's no more boxing on showtime anymore. I also got it for bellator mma but you took it off my list. I will try to cancel this weekend.Please let me cancel cause I can't pay for May. I want help to cancel it.
Kathleen Czarina Garcia,Love it!
Cara Honey,"Great streaming service! I've really enjoyed the show and movie selections. Some of the videos are available in 4K, Dolby, HDR, and HDR+, and all have HD as the minimum. So, the video quality is great! Especially when compared to other services that only offer SD. 5/5 would recommend ***** ftw"
Sydney J,Always shows an error and will not actually let me open to watch anything.. so what are we paying for!? We should get a discount each month based on how many times it doesn't work; it'd end up being free.
Courtney Cooper,Great informative and badly needed support. Relaxing knowing someone got my back. Thanx
Cara Jones,I love it
natasha friendly,Awesome. No issues
Isaac Aiken,Can't get in touch with Paramount always got to find another way to connect. Still not connecting.
Douglas Bran,great selection of movies and very interesting shows. I recommend the mayor of kingstown
John Sargent (Sarge),"Recently unstable, This app is not working correctly on my TV, often when there is an advertisement it just gets stuck, I can't back out of it to the selection area. I have to completely exit and then reload it and have to hope that that advertisement is no longer in the queue, or I have to replete the process. It took me 1.5 hours to watch a show that would normally only take about 45-50 minutes. It's beyond ridiculous for now, get something better."
Ross North,"This review is in no way about the programming itself. The shows are great which is why it is so frustrating that the app experience is so terrible. I use this app on my phone, tablet and Samsung TV. It is extremely frustrating on all three. About 30% of the time it jumps you back to the place in the program of the first ad after it's done playing you the second or third ad of the show. It crashes constantly especially during any live programming. It gets stuck regularly. No updates, no fixes."
Marisa Joy Williams,"I resubscribed to the service, but no app or ROKU or TV will acknowledge that I made a payment and updated my account. It says so in Google, but the app isn‚Äôt in sync or something. So I just paid money for nothing I guess."
Bekki Eason,Enjoy this app very much!!
melissa hart,Its not bad
Jay Marx,"Your chat keeps ending I'm going to cancel my membership. Someone is actively using my account without my permission and your chatbot isn't helping and cancelling the chat. I've changed my password and deleted the profiles they are making on my account and now they are using my profile. I will have to unsubscribe to your service now because even after I just upgraded my account to ad free I have someone using my account without my permission, and I can't seem to get help with the problem."
Michael Trevathan,"Dumped the service because they had the same movies, month to month with few exceptions. I come back three months later for a free trial and the same movies are still listed as new or popular. Not much to choose from unless you enjoy brain sucking reality TV. Don't get me started."
Jennifer,Crashes. App hasn't loaded in 3 days with numerous try. HOW DO I GET A REFUND?
Scott Madey,Great app. Glad I got it
Kat Deuster,Pretty sure the only thing worse than this app is glioblastoma.
Gabe Stites,Best app ever it has all the movies and shows I recorded
Jarrett Van Orden,works fine on TV until it freezes
E VG (Gorp),Very happy with how the app works and all the shows I can watch.
Jennifer Hilliard,Love the app.
Andres Ortiz,Show is so so good I love it
Cassandra Cox,"I am struggling to find something actually good with this app. It's just the worst. The picture lags, the audio is either off or non-existent, after every commercial break it starts where the last commercial break started. It's just... So bad. You can tell the company clearly only cares about money because if it cared about any of its subscribers, it would hire anyone who new how to make an app. Don't waste your money."
Mario Quinones,I Love this app . üíØ
Bryce Soumokil,Streaming sports is brutal on this app.
D M,On android tv the app does not mark watched episodes. I have had several shows that I have to start to watch and realized that I saw the episode already. Also why is their not a sign in button on the app instead of sign up only?
Brad Sutton,this is a great app I just whish I could get it. the episodes were great. A Gentalman in Moscow is a great show.
Eric Leonard,"only have it for serie a, continually ""goes to next episode"" when trying to rewatch a match replay."
Johnda Nelms,ok
David Garrison,great app just wish they had better horror movies
Matthew Burton,I don't know what happened on the latest update but after I choose a user I just get a black screen on my Android. It's always been terrible on my Firestick and now it won't work on my phone either?
Ash Brown,Fix the lighting please
J. Smith,"04/11/24 Still the worse streaming apps ever. I put up with it because I have no other choice. So, I binge watch the series, then cancel the subscription. All my other streaming platforms, I just keep. One of the worst streaming apps, ever. The only reason I use it is because I am a trekkie and I have too. Skips and pauses. Have to restart all the time. Even uninstall and reinstall. No, it's not my internet connection, because I have 4 other streaming apps and I dont have any issues with them."
Brian M,"Not currently working on a Moto G stylus 2022, and hasn't been for probably 6 months now. Stays stuck on the splash screen Paramount logo. Figured I'd wait on reviewing it for a update but so far there's been no change. Works on my tablet fine though."
Mindy Batie,Great way to catch up on the go. Love Paramount+
Haley Brawner,"For years the sound has been out of sync with Champions League matches. Most recently, the Real Madrid v Man City match had the commentary 3-5 seconds behind the action. It's completely unacceptable. For years, we had the champions league for free, and now I have the honor of paying for an app that can't figure out how to sync the sound with the live action. Wish I had any other option so I could cancel my subscription."
Bonnie Sanders,I DON'T WANT TO WASH ON MY CELL PHONE I HAVE A SMART TV
Jesus Padilla,"This app is a piece of garbage. It fails to connect most of the times, or the signal dies. Sound dies randomly and for no reason. The app crashes often. Also, I can't watch widescreen because the screen goes black."
Ricky N,The app won't even open unless I go through the website on chrome
K T,Great app. Works great for watching any shows on Paramount plus.
Ashley Miller,Good app but bad on fire stick. Otherwise love the shows
Joseph K,Live events ALWAYS have issues with buffering. Only streaming service we use it does this. Annoying.
Spiff Djennerit,Unusable on pc or phone. This app is broken and needs immediate attention
Kamara Mawby,"There's no option to upgrade to no ads, and the firetv app barely even works. It's constantly buffering. Very frustrating."
Kim Quigley,I love what you offer but I wish it was easier to watch. Your platform needs a ton of work.
Debbie Barringer,Good shows and movies
John Iocca,"App works great, it would be better if I could select my user permanently on my phone or at least the default."
Don hoskins,Great content but sometimes it glitches on my android tv
Ronald Dudley II (GummiBear),Technical Difficulties for over a month. ü§¨. The app will not even completely load. w When I try it says We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later. This is getting old.
Brandon Cairns,"It's ok, but when I try to watch something just with my phone, the captions are always there even when I have them switched off. I try to hit the bolt shaped button that I assume is settings and it doesn't work"
Seska Sides,"The app is fine no issues there I just wanna complain about them taking off all these shows that I specifically got the subscription for üôÑ I mainly got it for my toddler cause he enjoyed watching blues clues and you, while I enjoy the original and I'm happy it's still there but why take off the new one? I refuse to go get ANOTHER subscription for something just so he can watch it (just like what all the other streaming sites do) I'm just annoyed and wanted to complain ü´° k bye"
Deborah Sargent,Watching different stuff other than my Ancient Aliens! Love it.
Marquez Harris,I loved this app and the shows they bring. however not much content comes out or at least not as of late. Looking forward to seeing what's next for paramount+.
tanner Lyon,Thank gos im still in the free trial phase it crashes suoer often ill be canceling.
Ruben Lopez,Do you want to be ticked off and pay for it. Pay for this subscription. The worst buffering and lagging of any streaming service I have used. Great content but terrible service. They owe their customers and advertisers money for this non sense. I am trying to watch Survivor and in an hour only got 28 minutes into it because of terrible service. I don't usually complain or even write reviews but this stinks. So frustrating.
John Rice,Easily the worst streaming app. Freezes and crashes more than it works. An absolute joke
Christopher Crum,Awesome App
dsw rants,Requires wifi to download despite the fact I have unlimited internet and my cell service is faster than the wifi at the airport. It should give you the option like orne apps do
Rob Schafer,App will not open due to technical difficulties.
Lydia,"I've installed and uninstalled this app so many times, but not once has it actually opened. I'd give it zero stars (and one of these: üñïüèª) if I could."
Kurt Smith,THERE IS NO WAY TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH ANDRIOD.... DO NOT SUBSCRIBE THROUGH ANDRIOD!
Linda Edwards,Excellent.
Jody Guercio,"Phone - 3 out of 5 Firestick - -100000 NEGATIVE STARS......watch history doesn't update, freezes on both wired AND wireless connections...paying for the ad free version, but why when things get removed or sold to other services and removed mid series watch. I understand the business is to make money but if the company produced the show KEEP THE SHOW on the APP! Sublease it to other services or something ü§î"
michelle shepard,Serious issues with playback. It keeps locking up.
Timur Huong,Love it
Erika Jenkins,"Too Many Errors. I signed up recently and most of the day I get ""we're having technical difficulties"" errors and can't open the app. Not a great impression during my trial to decide if I want to keep it."
Mary (Scary mary),Good
Shawn Swafford,The app user style is good. What I don't like is they don't inform you your downloads don't work if you don't have internet without a more expensive subscription. Edit: it's got worse even once I do get a download with is extremely hard to do because it won't go then half the time they won't play. I like the content but this app is garbage....
mark Noneofyourbusiness,Gets stuck often. Definitely not user-friendly!!! Really f ING annoying. After a month I canceled even though they gave me a month free after that I never logged back on.
Paul Thompson,I love the show on this site
Temidayo Snr. Ajaka,Good
Andy Acker,"I wish there was a way to make the video fill the screen, rather than be framed and making the content 3/4 the size it could be. Also, options to sort your list and prioritize what you want to watch next would be better than having to hunt for it again."
Julian Morales,"Great service, great selection of TV shows and movies, I'm happy with this App üíì"
Tonia A,awful. can only watch when app allows otherwise it crashes and skips 90% of the time
Michael Enos,S-Goot; daw belly goot Jung mawn!!!
Kurt Tremblay,Gives me so many options!! Watching Survivor and my NCIS and NCIS Hawaii is gold every time
Adam,"Good shows poor ui and playback optimization especially for amazon fire sticks, im currently trying to just use my samsung device / iphone and the video will not play at all as it flickers to a ad first then blank black screen"
M R,It keeps going out to where I want to delete it but I like the shows it has. FIX IT PARAMOUNT
Travis,Wonderful app with lots of great selections of programming to view.
Daniel Gross,"Even at 500+ Mb internet speeds, the TV version of this app is not working on our Sony TV. It goes to a comercial at the start of every show, and during breaks, and then freezes. We have to exit the app and go back in. Sometimes the show gives us audio but shows a black screen. It takes us over an hour to watch a half hour show. Please 1. Change the system to not run commercials if it just ran one. 2. Give us the option of reducing the resolution if it keeps freezing."
John Crawford,"The app is buggy and often forgets where in the show you are after ad breaks, causing it to repay the last bit you just watched. There are also no Spanish subtitles."
Melchor Loret de Mola,"Worst STREAMING SERVICE OF ALL. No matter what TV or phone or tablet I use, it crashes and is slow and is just all around super frustrating. They are lucky they have exclusive rights to some shows. Figure it out CBS-Paramount or whatever entity owns it this year... Do Better."
Brook Wagner,AWESOME!!!
Robynne Williams,I love the easy access
Carlos Bermudez,App does not allow you to connect to TV.
LC,"I have this app on several devices. Thus far, this app always gives me trouble streaming. It either boots me out, freezes, or tells me it has technical difficulties. I messaged tech support and they refer me to their troubleshoot site. It takes multiple tries before i can watch a full show. I will cancel when my year is up. I do not recommend this service. Also, it's ad-free no more. The ads freeze then boots me out if the app."
Tim Allen,I often enjoy what Paramount Plus has to offer. Plus you can buy movies at a fair price.
James Myers,The movies we wanna watch that are on the list play when they want to can't watch them from the Xbox and us to pay more to watch them. Can't see the leaving soon list on the app. Will not let us cancel the subscription and reimburse for the time not used. Nobody wants to stare at a phone screen to enjoy a movie as a family.
Bruce Salazar,Great selection from movies to multiple great seasonal shows. Very much worth it!
Thomas Resh,Awesome üòé
Lourdes Hernandez,Great
Kaitlyn Brannon,"We were trying to watch survivor live tonight and the show kept lagging. To the point we had to go completely out of the app and back in, at least 3x. We missed entire scenes. The ads worked perfectly of course. We missed almost the entire challenge and a large part of the strategizing before tribal council. I'm not sure what is needed, but just my thoughts"
Richard,Excellent
levester green,Great!
habib mayowa,Sensational
Carlos Wong,App keeps crashing. I was doing the trial but will cancel the service because of that.
April Jungren,"App will not load, constantly crashing, not even allowing app to open properly."
Jamie Ponce,Great app
Harry,Very helpfull in my illiteracy in line smarts.
Dennis Smith,great app good entertainment
Joe Dodrill,I have it on my TVs love it mainly for star trek but I downloaded on my phone and it won't even get past the paramount screen if I could get that I'd be a 5 star for me
eric bush,"Watch it all the time, great. Need more Beavis and butthead."
Jade Caldwell,"The service has a lot of good content that I enjoy, but they moved some Star Trek to other platforms. As well, the mobile app is quite annoying at times with its latency playback issues that cuase repeated viewing of ads."
Kurt Feierabend,THIEVES!!! They charge my debit card - but block my viewing service. I call that theft!
Barb Ramey,Excellent choices at a reasonable price finally
Alisa Iverson,I love this app for my android phone but I keep getting error 600 I uninstalled it and re installed it and still not working for 2 day's now
Chad Moen,"Sign in to my account on the app and it won't let me watch anything. Has the get started, sign out, or watch free episodes option. Cancelled subscription because of this. I did reach out to Paramount+ about this and they were unable to help since I bought through the play store they told me."
AchiveMINT !,The experience Is really not that good of quality when it comes to the app on your TV. The fast forward and rewind is horrid and there is a ton of commercials all the time. When trying to view seasons and episodes is extremely difficult as well if there is a lot of the two(seasons/episodes).It doesn't have the worst content which is the only reason it is getting 2 stars.
Mr. Baker,Better than average choices offered by other streaming channels. I would recommend Paramount over other streaming services.
Jamie Collins,Good shows and movies but the n shows after commercials it reminds to prior watched section
Linda Pevlor,A lot of TV shows are on paramount+1
Jay Pitmon,They took down my first review. I was just being honest. For streaming app it's total garbage. If you read five reviews in a row they're all one star they cover all the issues I won't waste time being repetitive but I canceled my subscription It will not renew it. For me to watch Paramount+ is punishment not entertainment. Good riddance.
Jerimiah Dickson,This has to be one of the worst streaming apps on the planet. They made it incredibly hard to cancel the subscription. Basically impossible. The Link in app does not work because the UI is garbage. When I went to the website it just gave me a black screen. I had to go into the help section chat with the robot which gave me a bad link that didn't even work. So then I had to repeat saying I need help twice till I got a real person he was able to help me out. It should not be this hard to unsubscri
Ronald Bryant6,The Best Crystal clear movies
Joshua Champine,I only use this app for the champions League. They decided to add ads to the match I was watching. I switch to the other game no ads. I switch back and now I have to watch Nine 30 second ads. I switch the games again no adds. I go back to the game I want to watch and I still have to watch the ads. I pay for the app and you put ads in the middle of a program. Terrible business practice. Inspired me to write this review after the match.
Nonaya Biznass,"I pay for no ads, and yet, I get ads. It's easily solved by backing out of an ad whenever you see one and going back in (it effectively skips the ad), but I shouldn't have to do this. Minus one star until they fix that particular issue. The app works just like it should otherwise!"
Kevin Fry,Fresh Stuff .
Ronald South,At the end of the show or movie I like see the credits. You cut them off before they even get done with the credits.
Simon Hou,Absolute dirtbags. Showed a 5 minute ad segment in the middle of the Atletico Dortmund match. Why pay for something when the free alternatives won't even do that.
Mike Stro,It's all about Star Trek for me. This is awesome.
Jose Mendoza,Since when there's commercials in sports? Jesus Christ this is stupid
Adam,Cannot full screen individual Champions League Games on Google Pixel 7a. Can't only full screen the multi cast option....
K. I.,"The amount of ads is simply unacceptable. 1 to 4 ads in a row, every 5 to 10 minutes of what I'm watching. I've never seen that many ads, anywhere, except maybe Times Square. This is bad enough that I can't even finish my trial. EDIT: The ONLY solution that Paramount offers is to simply spend about 3x the price to go ad free."
Hector Gallegos,Literally cannot watch in landscape on my phone. What's the point?
Juliana Luafalemana,Alot of the movies are awesome thumbs up
Rk_ Kebien,This app sucks constant buffering unable to load pages or channels constantly crashes can't rotate my phone screen with out crashing just a miserable app
Deluna85403,"So bad slow n crashes when u try to go full screen lmaooo , this app is sooooo terrible"
Wilfredo Figueroa,Yesterday and today this app doesn't let me open to watch Champions League. Champions League is the only reason I pay for your service and couldn't watch on my phone. What's going on?
brahim mardy,It stops working
Elizabeth Bowers,The only think I don't like I can not get back to the 1st season
Taylor Bange,"Hands down the worst streaming app in existence. Will crash more in one episode than any other will in an entire year. Can't watch anything cohesively, it's very irritating. Once, they even tried to make me resubscribe, even though they had just charged me bank the week before. Will not be renewing the subscription further."
Gregorio B,"I've been trying to use this app for the last 2 months and always when I started up it says technical difficulties... I have an Android phone, an Android tablet and an Android TV and in neither of those devices the app works. Update: I found out that depending on the region you are and the country your account is, you will have problems. It seems that phone and tablet app works. What is not working is the androidTV app. No wonder why it is currently rated with 1.6."
J,"The audio is about two seconds behind on one of their Champion's League broadcasts, tried app, TV, Xbox, WiFi and 5G. It's a paramount problem. Even more embarrassing, they uploaded the replay with the delay!! Real Madrid v Man City 4.8.24. Just a 1 game error but damn it hurts to pay for 0 quality checks. With respect to their response, they clearly didn't read my post. Paramount+ does consistently have the worst quality control and streaming, a long term problem. Decent content though"
christian Longstreth,Could use a fresh design and experience.
Jaymo Cunning,The best movies
Alyssa Petty,I LOVE YOUR APP SO MUCH.
Stacey Adkins,Once you subscribe they try and make it almost impossible to cancel said subscription
Ms. T505,No streaming service should have commercials. Who wants to pay a fee for the stream and look at commercials. This is not regular TV. It's for enjoyment purposes. Rarely is a commercial funny. It's not the service that I'm angry with. It's the darn commercials. Can't you just leave them to regular TV and let me watch in peace. You don't see commercials in-between the movie at the theater and I paid for popcorn. Remove the ads and let them fight for themselves.
Latisha Begshisown,This app sucks there always something going on ... now it pauses every 5 seconds... I stopped paying and forgot why I stopped paying for this app ..before it would make me start the whole season over and I wouldn't have my place saved it would also be very slow fast forwarding and now it keeps pausing... then when u call they want to point the finger at ur internet ...well guess what I moved and changed services ... it's not the internet ... stop telling us to trblsht and fix ur app!!!
Don Delbert,Horrible. Save your money.
SULY HASINTO,great movies!
Travis Pearson,"Always crashes and never saves my spots in shows. The free peacock service is better and we actually pay for this one. No wonder you were $425 million in the red last year. I used apps created by 1 guy in his basement that works better then paramount plus. Like you make billions of dollers, but you cant make the app work? Do Better!!!!!!!"
Clifton Davis,I like it good choice
Mike Mike,"Mediocre This app is a pile of trash. Especially when he comes to uefa champions league. For a over a month ( mid February to end of March) match replays wasn't available on TV. Now( in April) every time I try to access the champions league, an error message shows up."
Henry Valentine,Poor UI. Inexplicable crashes. Very obviously inept design and development team.
Mason Cagle,I Love HALO
Kevin Thompson,The best!
Jo Na,"Hands down the worst streaming service I've ever used. Forget the app, even the website itself is terrible. I can't watch a single show or movie without the website crashing over and over again every 3 minutes. I tried all possible solutions like updating my browser, turning off VPN, clearing cache. It's their website itself. Paramount + SUCKS!!! I don't know how they're still even in business!"
Erica Idgnf,"I signed up for free play, and now it's taking them forever to verify my account.."
Magdalena Mendoza,Good shows and movies
Carlos carde,This app is absolutely useless can't load up successfully and if it does keeps crashing and there's no update to fix issue
Caleb Rocha-Brownell,I love Paramount+ but their app is the worst streaming app I have ever used. It is extremely laggy and very often unresponsive. There are episodes that are available that just won't even play. I'm paying to be able to watch the shows I love whenever I want. Please spend some money on fixing your app!
Reed Schneider (Ystervarke),Starts you at the end of episodes
Juan Vasquez,All the shows are so dim and dark I can't even see anything. S24 Ultra max brightness and nothing is visible.
Artur Prusinowski,A complete and total abomination of a streaming app that should be an embarrassment for this supposedly high profile streaming service. This dumpster fire has not been fixed since day one and in fact appears to be getting worse since the core issues with video streaming interruptions and overall quality remain but additional bloat has been added on top...edit. stop auto replying to bad comments. This app is not fixable it's garbage and there's nothing a normal user can do to fix it
Skippy Bob,"No ads, good movie selection"
Caitlin Roberts,"Honestly, this app needs work. I can not use the app at all on my fire tvs. Just error after error which makes it hard to watch things as a family. This alone is the reason why I won't keep paying for this app. I've tried all the fix-its that have been suggested and nothing works."
Tracy Houston,"App stalls a lot and when it hits a commercial it will literally rewind to the previous section that I already watched and I either have to fast forward or just rewatch the whole section again. This happens often whether I‚Äôm watching on my phone, on my fire stick, or on my chromecast."
emm java root,"Always find something that matches my mood, whether it be love struck or menacing, frightening or forgiving, never fails to deliver , thank-you paramount+"
LG,"Doesn't matter if I try using the app on my phone, ps4, or TV. The app is very glitchy. Constantly have to close the app and re-open. Will be canceling my subscription this month."
Angela St Amour,Love the content and shows üëå
D D,"UPDATED!!No matter what app. It glitches. Each glitch I've read in these reviews I've had all of them. On my phone, or smart TV and fire stick. The app really needs to be fixed. We are paying for shifty service. I'm not contacting you to waste my time with tech support play by play. Look at all the reviews it's across the board. Your app has major glitches. Instead of wasting our time and money. Test it again and fix it!!! People start canceling if they don't fix it soon!!!!"
Victoria Lopez,It was the best
Calvin Willis,Very nice.
Tammara Gatson,"It's constantly buffing, repeating scenes & restarting"
Sarah A,Can someone please fix it so when a new episode starts it doesn't take the video out of full screen mode on the computer?
Renee Beyer,it constantly cuts off and restarts during shows. especially after each commercial. Its one of the worst apps out there.
Cold Kutz,Great
Derrick,One of the best apps!!
Kelly Maxwell,Love it so far
Shannan Stearns,As just CBS I would of given them a 4/5. Play the last Paramount they get a 5/5 because there's movies there's other channels and there's a ton of other stuff to watch.
sandesh jonchey,Whats up with your subtitles? Loads before the actors say anything. Need to get the timing right! This is the worst streaming apl ever. No customer support. Won't let me login even after password reset.
Anthony Martinez,Me and my family have good time watching paw patrol the movie
Stephan P,"Great shows, but we shouldn't have to pay if we have to watch ads during the shows. Wasn't the paid service supposed to cover the ad revenues?"
Teddy,"Paid for a year of premium, and it *still* shows ads...ugh. I hate ads and pay not to see them. Frustrating. I did email support, and they said they ""refreshed"" my account, but signing out/in and reinstalling the app didn't fix the issue. I usually cast to my Chrome, and that won't let me skip thr ad at all. In the app, I can switch to another app and back again, and it will skip the ad."
Shae Green,"I had to get my monthly subscription from the online website because the app version said ""product not available"". That's fine, but when I finally get subscribed they still give me a 30 second commercial at the beginning of every tv show i watch? I don't understand why im paying so much when i still get commercials. Then, every few episodes my shows just stop loading. They will say ""optimizing video feedback"" on a blank loading screen and then never load. Bad app, will delete at end of month!!!!"
Daniel Hose,"Everything works, no problems"
Vargas,Love Paramount+ because it has everything I want to watch! Thank you Paramount+!!! üíñ
Mersage Wright,"This app directly crashed my phone, and it would not start for 30 minutes. The crash can be reproduced, so I am certain it is the app. Watching CBS live on the app and a smart TV will brick your device. The app is also experiencing a bug where fast forwarding a show on Android makes it think the episode is ending and the app forces you to skip to the next episode with no cancel button."
Ian Elliott,I got this to watch soccer. Every replay I click has very poor video quality. I was planning on starting a subscription but the video quality of these games is subpar.
Cody hooker,STOP SENDING ME TO THE APP WHEN I TYPE IT IN MY SEARCH BAR. THAT OR ALLOW US ACCESS TO ACCOUNT INFORMATION ON THE APP
Slawomir Ropek,This app and the CBS SERVICE is a joke!!!! You will never watch a game live!!! Waste of money!!!! April 2024... nothing has changed!
Mike Noviski,Great app. Needs to have better selection of horror shows but other than that its great
Samuel Norvell,If you think YouTube is bad with adds wait till you try paramount plus! The worst streaming service by far. An absolute nightmare and cash grab where all your shown is add after add after add after add and begged to buy premium.... DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Im slaughtering my three daughters tonight cause if PARAMOUNT+
Shalin Patel,I'm glad they show champions league but it's not smooth at all.
Maggie Handel,"The app doesn't work on my new LG smart tv. Every other app works just fine (Hulu, Netflix, Prime). Very annoyed that I only watch Paramount programs on my phone."
HiIQ,"4.9.24 Not falling for the latest update. Reviews are WORSE. Does not appear to work w Google hardware. 3.25.24 DOES not keep track of your place, at ALL. 2.25.24 Total AD black screen. UPDATE loads yet MORE ads. APP does not remember your place. Suckimus! 2.20.24 Sucks. Keeps rewinding to the beginning. BITE me. 2.14.24 UGH! Update SUCKs. After every AD, app rewinds to earlier portion of show already watched! Newest reviews are FAKE!"
May Carpenter,I love Paramount I think it's a great app exclamation mark
Paula Prates,Love it. Has live TV and I am able to watch my programs whenever I want
Darin Slwooko,I'm trying this for first time
Lynn Fassy,Terrible app. Paramount plus
Becky Brynjolfsson,"This app doesn't have the shows I want to watch. Friends, Third rock from the sun, Wil and Grace, Simpsons too many to mention is not there. It's terrible."
Marlo Ruggs,It was very good to see different things that I was not used to seeing I gave it 4 stars paramount was a good experience and I'll be able to get more of a good service and enjoy the time with using it now that I have down low it great movies and enjoy the time with watching TV and enjoy the commercial and the family really is enjoying it as well so I'll be able to get more movies and enjoy shows that would have been a great amount of money so thanks for the help and enjoying too continue to it
Carlos Duca,"This is by far the WORST streaming app, it continuesly freezes, has a difficult time loading. We have the fastest internet. If you want to fast forward, it will not like that and kick you out of the game your watching and start it over from the beginning. Then to top it off it only has 1 speed to fast forward. It doesn't matter if its downloaded to your TV, fire stick, or tablet it has severe issues loading, staying on what your watching and continuesly freezing at the best possible moment."
Chelsea Bradley,Always having technical difficulties
Marcos Romero,It's always glitchy during tv shows and some movies. And while it's glitchy it also has issues with voice not matching while talking is going on.
Anh Nguyen,"Extremely fishy that after my free week trial has ended and on my first billed day, I can no longer stream anything (ERROR 6000) on neither my Android TV or Android Phone!! Playback during first week was horrendous as well with constant 1-2 second pauses and lags. Either fix this asap while I'm on my day off or refund me my money, PLEASE!!!! UPDATE: After calling your support 24 hrs ago, I have still yet to receive any call or email back regarding this issue! So STOP with your A.I. response!!"
Jimmy Eck,Nice playlists of Movies and TV shows. Need more newer content
Jim T (cozy 117),Won't let you disable that subtitles
Kenneth Hurst,Great shows
Riley Howard,"Lots of shows to enjoy, but watching shows on the app gives you commercials like real TV. Pretty lame"
Melvin Baires,App has technical issues way to much
Holly Burns,I like it
Michael Johnson,This application is garbage when I use it on my Android TV which any other application works as expected it's barely even watchable it skips it's it's slow to load it's it's horrible and it continues to be so even with every update that they have it's no change and it's not my internet connection because I have a fast internet connection and no problems it's not any blocked ports or anything is purely 100% solely this application garbage
Daniel Moreno,"wont open, errors out"
Israel Ghezmu,"Worst app ever keep crashing, even the TV app, we paying y'all. Y'all should work on y'all app. It's ridiculous can't even watch champions League and I'm paying every month. THIS IS A SCAM. Definitely cancelling my subscription. Anyone whose trying to get a subscription it's not worth it. There are amazing streaming service like max, Disney Plus and so on."
pa pan,This app doest work on Ssung S10+. Latest software updates. Please fix. I am paying.... it still doesnt work! Grrrr
Jose Lagunas,Only got this for champions League and it's not working.
angelo j,Love it
Hudson,Fails to play live TV or sports
Adam Michael,"If you're buying for UCL, don't bother. Audio lags way behind video. Save yourself the money and find an online stream"
juan gomez,Why do I pay if every 5 minutes you're gonna be interrupting live broadcasts? Fix your issues
Kenneth Simpson,"*UPDATE #refundmenowplease Decided to reinstall and resubscribe, same issues. Error 6006 every time. Troubleshooting (that I already know to do and what Paramount says) didn't help and I can't get an agent. I'd like a refund. Paying to watch my Champions League but can't get the service? Refund me please. This has been happening for months and out of all the streaming apps, you give the most problems smh #refundnow"
Raul Ayala,Every time I try watching anything that's live full screen it just goes to black and I have to close the app. So horrible.
William Stryker,Terrible app. Goes blank when you try to flip it to full screen. Whats the point
Rudy Guerrero,won't even launch the app it's terrible I've deleted and re downloaded multiple times download any other streaming service cause this is by far the worst one
Jamaica Yvonne,Sign up for paramount+... I am signed up. Just use PC if possible. Worthless üòû. I also noticed that they're trying to say that you can get Paramount plus Showtime without ads? I'd like to see that package I have ads with my Showtime.
Cindy Browning,"Got Partamount + free with Walmart+ but you can't watch it because it is always going out , but if I paid for it then I can watch anything but free with Walmart+ it doesn't work"
Anthony Collins,"It constantly freezes on commercials. Freezes, as nothing responds and you have to either wait for it to restart, 2-3 minutes, or you have to force it to close. Then when you restart your program, the commercial break starr all over again. This app also lags by 1-3 seconds, meaning you need to click a button then wait until it responds. It also takes a minute to come to clarity. When you activate the app, it's definition is very low. CBS should just sell these shows to another streaming app."
Bree Maghen,Like any other streaming apps the ads are annoying especially if it's showing the same one.
Kenyetta Scott,Wonderful!!
Jacob Maxey,"Paramount is clearly paying for fake reviews of this terrible app. This app - this app alone of all the streaming platforms - consistently crashes my entire TV, requiring me to yank the power cord out of the back. If you read the reviews, you will see that this is totally broken from a technical perspective. They will reply to your negative review with a bunch of useless articles (see below reviews), but they will not fix their broken apps. I cancelled my subscription, and you will too."
Kevin Stueber,The best app great shows and movies.
Sarah Garlick,Cancelling my subscription has me jumping through hoops. This is ridiculous
Ronald Pawliske,Very slow
Brady Kubley,"theres no way to add my walmart + free benefits but theres also no way to cancel my free subscription. Worse than Netflix. Dont waste your time and sanity on Paramount, guys. I'm now getting attempted debits to my bank account all day every day, no surprise there. But I was smart and signed up for the free trial with a bank account that just stays empty. I know Paramount is dismayed at that, money hungry criminals they are"
1/2 FILIPINO CHRIS,GOOD GOOD ü§åü§å
Jason Land,Love it great app
Bobby Connett,Will not work anywhere and will never let you sign in. Constantly having issues. Customer support is unintelligent and offers no help with fixing issues. Rude as well. I recommend if you need paramount plus getting it through Amazon as an add-on. I did that and have had no further issues. Good luck to anyone who is having similar problems
Kati Kennedy,Love the available shows and movies but can't watch anything all the way thru. Try to watch one episode of a show and it crashes 100000 times.
Ricardo Selles,"Unfortunately this app is terrible. I've downloaded and erased it on multiple occasions just to see it will work, but it never does. I always get an error message whenever I try to open it. How am I supposed to enjoy my account when I can't even open the app?"
Robert Bellow,Love the content. Love catching up shows that I miss because of my schedule. My only issue is the downloading. And it's not my connection or wifi...it's something in the app. Other than that I am loving the app.
D'Ann Osborne,Great shows
Greeneyed Bella,"This app is constantly telling me it's experiencing technical difficulties. I end up seeing a black screen when I open the app. Or I could be watching something and all of a sudden the same thing will happen. On the days it works its great, lots of options to choose from. Good movies also. But please can you fix this. All my other streaming platforms work fine not my internet. The numerous amounts of people telling you something is wrong with your streaming service I'd think you'd fix it already"
Jason Aliano,"Worst streaming service ever! Longest and most frequent commercials. Shows won't pause, fast forward or rewind properly. You can't continue watching a show or it starts over. ALL BECAUSE OF THE PERSISTENT COMMERCIALS! They override every function. WE ARE DONE WITH IT."
Ken Corneliuson,"Terrible, watched 9 ads in about 20 minutes"
Rosa Morales,Great happy
Zach,Can't disable the auto open for the app. Makes you go to the browser to manage your account just to automatically redirect you back to the app.
Isabell Winchell,It doesn't have the greatest selection of shows or movies. I can get 3√ó as many movies on free apps. Plus the app only wants to work half the time. It constantly crashes and it's definitely not worth paying for a subscription
Ken Hamrick,App will not open unless I open Paramount plus on the web.
Etanarvazac Revorix,"The previous buffering issue was resolved but not without introducing a new bug. This new bug happens upon using the home key when trying to close Paramount Plus. This bug essentially locks the device on a black screen and completely prevents the home, recent and back keys from working. You can't even use a assistant like Google or Bixby to switch apps. The only work around I found is to turn off the screen using the side key to lock the phone. Upon unlocking the device should work normally....."
Jared Collins,"Update 2 years later: somehow this app is even worse than when it first launched. Commercials frequently cause the app to freeze and stop working. TV shows will only play intermittently. Frustrating to use, reacts to commands slowly, won't play live matches. The worst thing that could have happened to sports was CBS getting any contracts. You can only watch certain games on this app and it only works periodically. Someone should buy all the shares of this company and disolve it."
Sherry Boyd,Best streaming service available . Don't have enough time to watch everything I want!
elisha finch,why does my continue watching not leave off where i was last watching ughhh
Jesus Christ,It a real great
Alma Flores,Paramount has many of my favorite movies. Great!!
Lonnie Strong,It's been great I just don't use it much I've got a bunch of others
Jack Frost,Easy one fun
Henry Smith,"Plenty of choices, good mix of old and new. And it fits my meager budget."
J.J. daCool,butt ads causes app to somehow become uninstalled. Seems to have started after april 3 2024.
Tim Mustard,The app won't even open It's useless
Mdike Mike,"Great app, lots of content. Easy to use and keeps me entertained."
ghost runner,good shows and movies by a horrible gritty app shouldn't have to be paid for if you just want to watch some shows and then most of the time gritty
Ted Merchant,Works fine. Ad-free tier is not free of ads. Still must sit through 30-60 ads at the beginning of shows for other Paramount+ content. Ridiculous.
Carolyn Wade (WV Angel),"I do like it but it does crash alot and say content unavailable or something in that order , and u have to restart it !!!"
Tiffani Graham,This app sucks can't even get past the blue screen...ughhh
Carlos Manzo,One star is way too much for this app that never works
Aurora Pille,Way too many ads the price to go ad-less is not worth the amount. I would pay a few extra dollars for a no ad option but not 6-7 for showtime that I don't watch just for ad free.
Chance Parker,Ex p
Jude Hernandez,Love the app.
Mike Harris,Best original series hands down
Katie Davis,It used to be good. I can't watch a show now because of the commercials. The shows freeze at the commercials and it stops the show. Tonight I spent 2 hours trying to watch a 45 minute show. The commercials would freeze... then give me an error that the video was unavailable at this time. Then when I restarted it was back to commercials on a loop. Paramount... hope you're enjoying all the $ from commercials. You're losing mine.
Calvin Flowers,"I'm having issues keeping working on my devices. Sometimes it works, and other times, it does NOT. Also, I can NOT cast with my phone most of the time."
Daniel Gonzalez,Worst streaming app. How does free PlutoTV owned by the same people is so much better?
Loralea Sumner,I love it
Eric Ahwong,Awesome app
J D,"Having same issues as everyone else with the app freezing on multiple devices. With it happening on multiple devices, and to multiple people, it should tell developers it's not our devices that need to be restarted, and I shouldn't have to waste my time contacting your support team. How about your tech team just fixing the issue that I don't have on any other streaming service. This is getting tiresome."
Jason Castillo,Top 10 worst app.
Rafael Lopez,"No ""Next Episode"" button. Why not?? Edit: Next Episode button added!"
Benny Lami,Better than Netflix. Amazing content and easy to navigate
Theresa Bill,Get to watch what I want when I want. Only 1 day delay for currently running programs which is great if I miss an episode.
Sophia White,"It won't allow me to cancel my subscription, and I can't contact anyone."
Lucy M. Coronel,I like Paramount. I can see my favorite TV shows and some TV shows I can not see with other app channels.
Annette Coast-Anatra,My favorite app. Thanks for all Star Trek and Gentleman in Moscow!
Theresa Rogers Simpson,It works as it should.
Gary Springer,Excellent choice in tv an movies live the variety.
Weseley Hansen,"Magnificent, love the streaming speed and the types of movies and shows are awesome."
Douglas Sexton,Great programs but the app constantly crashes. Usually during the damn advertisements. If I'd had to pay for this I wouldn't think twice about cancelling.
Chris Delia,Good only glitches with bad Internet
Mike W,"When you sign up for the basic package, it says minimal ads. B.S, it's 90 seconds of ads every 15 minutes. I'm going to upgrade tomorrow, if I see another ad, I will cancel and pirate everything this service offersüòíüòí"
Bridgette Endsley,Don't ever put new episodes gotta wait at least two weeks or a month and I only got this subscription for two different shows and if it doesn't release new one's I'll be cancelling this one.
Jacqueline Young,"Absolutely love Paramount+ however, I find that it glitches way more than any other app."
Sergio Perez Henao,I have tried to download the app three times. But I always get an error message when I try to access the app fromy phone. A shame that I'm paying for a service that I can't use.
Flora Dexter,"I have lots of shows I watch on here, and its really frustrating when the app is constantly freezing and not knowing where I left off or will be in my ""Continue watching"" when I start a show.. Good things to Watch very poor quality app that i wish would get fixed."
Raoul Duke,Smallest collection of content out of any streaming provider. 6 ads before a movie. Canceled.
Amy Schneider,Constantly having to reset or uninstall and reinstall. Randomly freezes then starts program over. Funny they say they will help trouble shooting. The trouble is the app doesn't work 80% off the time. Having to reset 4-5 times to watch 1 show because it freezes completely or just stops with an error message.
Alfredo Nava,Awesome app!
Wayne Watson,Great
Leanna Sandoval,üëç good
Dean Miller,"Loading and laggin, tkes forever for the app to open on certain devices. When i comme back from a set of ads it jumps me back to the beginning of whatever im wathing."
Jake Donaldson,Awesome
SU Bauers,Always showing technical error please try again later.. ery disappointing
Teena Duff,I love it but why do I still get an add when I pay to not have adds. I have a traumatic brain injury and adds hurt my sensory stimulation üò¢
Georgia mills,"Uhugpktou us, TX 609nonl9"
William Quillin,I have enjoyed using the app. It has always met my choices and works well
Shelley Reeves,Love this app!!!
Super Sparkly Love,Update 4/8/24: 1st... the customer service on the ph and on here is great! My problem was resolved. I would've kept the subscription if I didn't have to tighten up my finances. I'll give 5 stars for customer service. Garbage!!! Straight Trash!! 4/2/24: Why am I being charged when I no longer have a subscription? I went on the website and the app to cancel bc of the reoccurring charge of $6.41 yet when I go on the app or website it tells I need to subscribe.
Ryan Lawson,"Use to be a great app. Now it gives my nothing but problems. About 80% of the time it won't play the video I want to watch. Downloads just delete them selves without watching, that's saying if they ever download to begin with. I find my self having to go online and watch from the website, which is a lot harder than being able to us the app. I have tried the different recommend fixes or trouble shooting and none of them ever work. Just a waste of time."
Sam Benson,Keep getting technical difficulties notice. Then boots me out. Wanted to watch offline downloads while traveling but has not worked since I left US. Not a happy camper
Alexander Gnaden,It is a good app to get
Bobby Lee,There are no streaming difficulties. The App. is user friendly. Really enjoy the wide selection of movies.
Siren,"When I try To stream It on my TV. For some reason, there's always an issue. That's the only reason why I gave it 3 stars."
Kiresten A.,"Doesn't keep track of watched shows, and the ads (promotional spots) are excessive for an ad free plan. Support couldn't help. It wasn't always like this but it's becoming more unusable."
K Stanburry,"The worst streaming app out there. Glitching and restarting for no reason. The ONLY thing that plays is the ads, and they will repeat for no reason. I keep looking for an update, but obviously paramount still has no solvent for their issues. Switching to Sling to record content instead of paying for this app."
Shawn Bauer,Good consistant stream ‚Åπ
Anne Chatelain,"The app doesn't load past the logo screen. It just a blue screen with the logo, and stays there no matter how long I leave it to sit. I have a galaxy s21 ultra, it's not something wrong with my phone. Do you just not want people to watch your stuff on phones? I have had this same problem every time I try to download the app for the last year. What is happening?"
Felipe Lopez jr,You have my shows with very little buffering
Chaoslordgreen,Nice place to see star Trek and a few movies
Chris E (Clockwork),Poor controls when using the app
Donna Johns,Great content. üòÄ
T D Foreman,Great movies
Emma Davis,Absolutely love Paramount
Inez Myrie,when you try to rotate the screen on my tablet it just goes back üò≠ but you can hear the screen
Joe Skarupa,What a rip off. Used to get NCAA on CBS. Now you charge for the big game. I'll never pay a dime to any CBS affiliate. CROOKS!
Johnnie Johnson,It's solid
A Google user,"This is great. MORE,MORE,MORE please!!!!!"
David Tyson,Best place for Trek fans
Derk Howard,"I really dislike the video play back feature. Most of the time it goes too far back and I'll have to rewatch commercials, or watch parts of the show I already watched."
Gimmy Northcott,I submit a delete account i don't want That sorry
Reginald Smith,Awesome
Gigi Mateo,"Kept buffering. And then i would get error 6000. I already uninstalled and reinstalled, I still get error 6000."
Holly Elizabeth ‚ÄúEli‚Äù Badman,It isn't always working
James Martins,"A cool app, never experienced any issues"
Pete Souris,Great shows and exclusives . New content constantly . Blockbusters and live t.v. Recommend !!
Lyndell Gillean,"Nothing but problems on our TV. Shows run fine, but the ads freeze up and never restart the show. You have to leave, then open another app, then go back to the show again, and it might work or not. Just so tired of the problems. Not worth the money for the ads either."
Merrick Donnelly,The hamsters powering their network modems must be sick. I have 2gigs of high-speed fiber internet and this app still runs slower than than snail snot.
Michael Griffin,Love this app so much worth 20 stars definitely download it and it's very cheap
Robert P,"Not a good app or experience at all, constant issues, restarts back to beginning of shows after as play, laggy, poor performance on every device. Unable to sign in on Xbox, won't run in Oneplus tablet... Just disappointing overall."
Cynthia Kelley,"It's a really good platform, you definitely get a wide variety to watch. I have some of the other platforms but this one is definitely worth the money"
James Collins,"Good app, lots of quality content"
Drew Bartelo,So much buffering and lagging and skipping that it has become unusable. To the point that it's made me no longer be a paying subscriber.
Jacob ‚ÄúCrazypedia‚Äù Schleappi,"Unwatchable on chromecast. Episodes skip to different parts after each Comercial Interruption, and just full on crashes often, both in chromecast and when watching on my phone. The commercials themselves are often distasteful."
Tina Ware,I have been trying to install and open this app but always says having technical issues
Jayde,Granted I like Paramount Plus but this error code 6000 keeps happening and it's annoying. I had to skip episodes and reinstalling didn't work.
Tyler Durbin,"Would be lower than one star. After paying for it, it basically locked me out of my account and cant get back in. Besides that , it basically gets the other streaming sites leftovers"
Tiffany Schmidt,Pay for this to watch cmt award's and give us the run around still can't find them at all
John Struse,Unbelievable bad
Vengeful Wraith,Constantly crashes on fire TV. Tech support keeps telling me to uninstall and reinstall but this does not work. Will be canceling my subscription.
Ivo,works great
TheHumboldthunnie,"Because I can't give you less, half the time the app doesn't work or it exits out and returns you to the firestick main menu, this is the second time I have tried to make a subscription work with paramount and I will be canceling once my month is up. Also tv shows don't continuously play it stops after a episode. I tried uninstalling and re installing didnt fix it I never write bad reviews but I feel like this was a waste of time and money"
Nick Stanfill,"The app crashes so often I just have to expect it to happen at this point. Things are slow to load, skipping an intro takes just as long as watching the intro, and you have to enable closed captions EVERY time you start a new show. Not to mention all the content is subpar or can be found on other platforms or just around on the Internet. Don't waste your money."
Spencer Griffin,"Extremely buggy. Prioritizes ads over video playback. Scrubbing to other parts of a show plays more ads. When coming back from playing ads, the video freezes while the dialogue continues. An ad will play at the end of an episode, then the credits will play, then a new episode starts with more ads. If you don't allow this to happen, then the ""keep watching"" selection brings you back to the credits of the episode that you just watched."
John Armstead,It's what Prime should be!
Karlotta Powers,I like that the app has the latest movies & TV shows. It has become one of my favorite apps to use. No true complaints other than showing me shows or movies for other apps. I don't want them or to upgrade/ add more and that can be a bit frustrating. Other than that this app gets it's!
Richard Stephenson,"I have a brand new phone Galaxy s23 Ultra and this is the only streaming service app that is extremely glitchy, there's nothing to do with my internet speed"
Michael Marro,"Horrible app. For the past two weeks, it won't download and if by chance I get lucky it takes forever. Then sometimes it won't let me watch offline even though I have downloaded shows. App crashes constantly on my TV and phone, customer service is horrible. Trouble shoot over and over and still it won't work properly, and also the library ain't great. I am done with this app and won't be renewing at all."
protoman21,Crashes all the time. Asks me to rate it every day. Well here you go.
Randy Martin,This app sucks. It constantly freezes on top of having advertisement this app should be free until it gets fixed
Jill Tripp,Its the only free app with all the programs I watch. LOVE it !
No Name,Have only watched have of one show. So until I have more time with the app the best I'm going to give it. When I have more time with the app I will be better able to do a better review. Except Paramount's got to be sure and charge everybody for use of the app. And if I have to pay for the app then there should be no commercials. But there are commercials so there's one star that will keep it from getting a five-star rating
Erick Rodezno,I LOVE IT
Samantha Wolfe,App is super unstable. Skips to the next show or won't play at all...
L Hernandez,Freezes up too much
Derrick Johnson,I can watch what I want while other do what they want
Jacob Moore,If I select and pay extra for the no ads version I expect to not have any but I still get them in the beginning of certain shows that's very annoying and why Ill be avoiding this app. Also the PS5 app version is so slow and laggy it's impossible to use.
Jeremy ski,Charged my card for a free trail was not supposed to get charged until the 14 th
Marcos Ortega,App works as expected. Good variety of shows offered.
CJ Sisneros,All I want
Elaine Harmon,So far no issues and a good selection of movies
Brett Mastin,Absolutely love the programing on this application. I love Star trek
Dawn Meadows,Sucks!!
0T_46,"This app is extremely buggy on phone, TV, Tablet, Everything. I keep getting ads when I have the ad free plan. It constantly crashes and the on screen controls don't show up half the time."
Robin Stern,Horrible streaming on fire TV and Pixel 8pro with 300 meg fiber connection. Terrible support. Do not recommend.
Kirk Ridley,All the good CBS programing üòÄ
Walter Moody,"Most everything works the way is supposed to but I can not rewind back up or start over. If I try the app on my phone, tv or roku freezes and goes back to the show menu for resume. I've tried deleting app and reinstalling and updating nothing makes it better"
Maya Pastorelli,Amazing...no need anything else
Derik ‚ÄúD‚Äù,"Every time you try to rewind when you have missed something or want to watch a part again it freezes up, sound continues sometimes & other times its no sound with & without a picture. After this, most of the time you have to exit out of paramount to (for me) the roku home screen; only once in a while does that work, more often ( i ) you have to restart the roku. Ridiculous considering how often things happen that requires one to need/ want to rewind! This is why low rating, give 4 star if fixed."
John Rush,Great shows and movies
Paul Bliss,Love it
Carla Varro,Great
James McGarity,Paramount+ has some great shows and movies and the app runs smoothly. Paramount+ is FREE with Walmart+ and Walmart+ is FREE to Walmart Associates. The universe unfolds as it should.
Jason Metzger,"Poor experience. App is awful compared to most other streaming services. Takes a long time to load, freezes constantly, loads commercial blocks multiple times in a row if you try fast forward to a different point in a show. After watching multiple commercial blocks it frequently freezes and you must start all over again. Appears there is little support being applied to fix issues. Before the blanket response happens, the app cache was cleared, uninstalled, and updated."
daniel cape,works great
Daphnie Bruno,Never had any issues.
Reinaldo Jr Santiago,Amazing experience
Bernardo Maldonado,"All I can say ,it's entertainment at the palm of my hands any place anywhere!!!"
Trena Patrece,"Update2: APP STILL UNRELIABLE, PLEASE TEST ON ALL PLATFORMS (LAPTOPS, TABLETS, ROKU, FIRESTICK) AND NOTE THE DIFFERENCES THE APP IS STILL SLOW!! IT'S LIKE THE GRANDFATHER OF THE APP FAMILY. All of the other apps run so much faster and smoother. PEACOCK, HULU, NETFLIX, APPLE+...and the list goes on...Paramount....please do what's needed, because the end users are dissatisfied and disappointed Whats happening with this App lately."
Kelechi Thaddeus Opara,Over a year and You still can't pause or rewind live games on roku TV
Craig Boudreaux,"Update 4/7/2024: now Paramount+, STILL THE WORSE STREAMING S/W I've used. Frequently after commercials, it will jump to a previous spot in the program. NO ONE else does that! 5/7/2020: This is still the worse, most consumer unfriendly app I have ever used. It breaks often and if it breaks, you have to watch another series of commercials. Lately, it breaks WHILE the commercials are playing, so you have to start over with another set of commercials to get back to where you were."
Michelle (Shells),Great movies
Lori Zoch,Faster than watching on the TV app that is sooooo slow.
Douglas Sexton,New review. The ads cause constant crashing.I'm glad I don't have to pay for this. I won't. I've tried everything even lowering the resolution on my devices and this keeps crashing. I'm using a Google Chromecast and a Onn Google TV stick and the other apps work fine and I will not do a bunch of troubleshooting bullsh*t.
Victoria Far m e r,Great streaming service. My grandsons love the Nickelodeon programs. I love the other content.
Derecia Walkine,Love the shows that are accessible and there is always something for everyone from my 8 year old with the child profile to my mom when she is looking for some of her classics...we love it.
Ricardo Izaguirre,Poor
Shaun Dykal,Great app. to watch your favorite t.v. show or movie.
Tammy Lind,Fantastic ü§©
Neat Maetris,Need more SiFi
Savannah Pope,"I have been a member of Paramount for two and a half years. Recently my membership expired. Today, I made a payment, and given some time, Paramount had me back up so I can continue to watch my fav shows."
Eloy M,Freeplay
Riah ‚ÄúBabyTru‚Äù Tarness,Only watched the Superbowl of 2024 not gonna pay for something I only used once
Michael Baker,"App will not work properly and the cancel subscription link will not open, had to move mountains just to cancel subscription."
Chris Bojorquez (BatMite51),App doesn't open for me. I've tried reinstalling it a few times but it stays frozen at the Paramount logo.
Melinda S,Half the time it won't play. I get a video unavailable message.
Kristi Druge,It has a lot of shows and movies I want to see
Brent Milliron,Love the content. Minimal interruption.
Debra J Otero Henderson,"I have some difficulty watching my shows, but not all the time. I think it has more to do with internet than the app or Paramount +. I love the convenience of clicking to watch anything I want. Thank you!"
Shawn Derby,Hands down the glitchiness most frustrating streaming service I've ever used. Literally dozens of apps and it's the worst even though it's one of the most expensive. I can't stream it on my TV because it won't load videos so I have to open on my phone and cast to my smart tv. Half the time the commercials restart the entire episode. I'll try to fight it long enough to watch Halo and cancel my subscription. Absolutely garbage.
Aaron Bougher,BEST OF THE BEST 2024
Brian,It works most the time I don't know if it's my phone. Or app. It good shows
Regina Patton,love paramount +.
Marietta Stanley,Cannot cancel. They make it impossible!!!
Jon Peterson,Very good place to start watching the streams of total and complete excitement
Megan Mungin,it worked great for a few days now it freezes right after it comes in n wont work again
Richard Ojeda,Paramount Plus is really good to have gots old school TV shows that I grew up watching I'm loving it
Devin Gagliardo,The shows suck and the documentaries are full of obvious lies. Would give zero stars if I could.
Sherrie barber,Love watching movies
lene Attakai,Love watching the ancient animals
Jason C,Haven't had so many issues with connection since using dial-up
Jaynie Barse,"Could use more variety movies.like, change every few wks."
Donna Sorise,"Everything works fine. Picture, sound. No lagging. Pleasantly surprised ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Billy A,This App won't even open. What a waste.
Mark Wordelman,Fix the buffering!!!
Andrew Bauman,App constantly freezes or doesn't work. Now they are loosing content. Trying to cancel with no success. May have to issue a charge back with my credit union.
Kyncha Lopez,I love this streaming app!!!
Mitch Woeste,Like the programs
Austin M UPSHAW,Totally liked
Jeremy Kuris,This app is so buggy it makes the Disney+ app look rock-solid.
Peters,"Can't watch, it says opti,izing then will load for a min before saying ""This video cannot be played"""
Joshua Wolf,"Improved, but locks up on advertisements and keeps resetting shows, requiring multiple extra ads to get back to where I was, after already watching ads. It's amazing how many ads are gambling. Grainy video quality while buffering video is also a bit irritating."
Art Pang,"Great content, but terrible app. Downloads don't start and you have to turn wifi off if you're on an airplane just to get it to load. It should default to your downloads if it doesn't detect internet instead of crashing."
Chris Thornbloom,It's got good shows love them
Vooshaeu Washington,This is very good u can watch what ever you wanna see
Lisa Bauer,My favorite streaming app!!
Amanda C Hanley (Cherokee Dawn),I love that when you can watch the show immediately after its airing on the TV channel I'm so happy that I don't have to wait a day after the show airs on TV to watch it on Paramount+
Achee Winnie (RECOVER),One of the central apps to have to enjoy top entertainment options with great stories.
Paul Randall,"Always crashing on GoogleTV and Android phone. Very frustrating, especially once it loads I still have to watch a commercial even on premium."
Lisa Isablogger,"It's 2024, where's picture in picture"
Robert Combs,"Horrible app,all it ever does is freeze up no matter where I play it from tablet,tv,roku stick buyer beware if this wasnt a black friday deal I would have stop my subscription asap! I NEVER have any problems , like this from Net Flix,Amazon Prime, Roku device kicks me sometimes but Paramount+ is highly unstable"
Teresa Cassidy,No way to access credit card information or subscription information.....
M,Omg it is a horrible app. It should be free. It don't work right most of the time and you could find the same content of a free app. Not many original shows.
Branden Wind,I can never get it to pick up on the episode that I'm in I always have to do it myself and skip forward in the episode where I left off no matter what I try it doesn't stay on the current episode it still shows that I'm 2 seasons behind where I am Needless to say this is quite annoying
Oscar Oliva,Great shows great movies and a great deal.
Michelle Best,Awesome streaming
Sabamika,Don't look for this service to be around much longer. It's not making them any money. And Paramount was recently downgraded to junk stock due to their outstanding debt.
Sara Kaitlin,This app is the worst. It's so slow and it glitches on every device I own.
Gene Pincomb II,Commercials keep causing the App to freeze and skip when casting to a Chromecast.
Katie Harwood,"Glitchy If you get out of a show, then back in, it starts back over at the beginning. If you try to fast forward, it takes you back to random spots. Very annoying."
Jama Ballenger,Love all the channels offered.
Michael Ray,The only app on my fire tv that will absolutely will not steam. I highly suggest you update your app!
Jerry Duke,"I have had this app on prime where it worked extremely well. I'm currently streaming it straight through the app on tv and my phone. On my phone it's seamless, no problems at all but on my tv it is next to impossible to rewind. Other than that I have no problems with it."
Stacy Bogard,"This ap is terrible. It always crashes (I try to use it on the Fire Stick) and half the time I can't get shows or movies to even play. I've tried force stopping the ap and restarting and it didn't fix the issue. I really hope they are working on an update to fix the bugs. I've never had a problem with Hulu, Max, Netflix, Prime Video, or Peacock."
Brandy Nash,some of the best shows around! love this channel!
Aaron Sanchez,Holding back on the episodes. That part sucks. Having to wait like it's TV what is this the 90's
Jahmir Covington,Good shows on there
cary joyce,The app has delivered clear enjoyable entertainment for me haven't cast it to any other monitor yet sound is great through my ear buds as well as on my phone
Javier Lara,the best app for old series and movies
Tina Glover-Logsdon (Street Angel),"Constantly freezes multiple times while watching. I'm hoping that they will fix this soon, or I'm canceling my subscription"
Fernando Magana,Great app. Love the way it makes sure to optimize before continuing.
Luis E Martinez,Just perfect!
La-Toya ‚ÄúHeartless‚Äù Artis,I love it
MG,Some of the older shows have theepisodesin the wrong order. The wild thornberrys for example.
Brandon Jarrett,Great selection of movies and love the choices they have for exclusive shows as well.
Erica May,Great selection for kids and adults for only a small price!
Amanda Mcclanahan,"Paramount is by far the best streaming service today! It not only has an astounding selection of the best shows and movies, but it also isn't as glitch as Netflix."
Amilcar Hernandez,"La aplicaci√≥n no abre en el celular, ya desinstale y instale de nuevo para probar pero sigue sin funcionar, mal servicio"
Miranda Crew,Love this site!
Ricardo Soto,Good movies and shows to choose from
Krystal Baker,Thank you for fixing the issues. It is a great app now.
sue C,I'm going to give it 3 stars only because I am unable to watch on my phone through the app icon. I HAVE to EVERY SINGLE TIME go through the Google play store and open the app there in order to watch anything. PLEASE FIX! Will change to 5 stars once fixed!
Stephen Fleury,"Worst of all the streaming apps, by far!"
Clarissa Cantu,"App keeps stopping, and commercials sometimes take up back to the beginning of the show."
adrian hudson,Very good personal services
Yoli Cruz-Swanson,Great app!!!
Shannon Wells,"Greatly improved over the last couple of years. I was very unhappy with this streaming app when we first started using it, and I gave it a bad review. I suddenly realized that though the app had improved a lot, and I don't have problems watching the shows I enjoy, I never updated my review. Thanks for making improvements."
Sharon Williams,Love that I have access to all my favorite shows anywhere.
Eric Krause,"This service has great content, quality and design... Had performance issues, devs fixed it,no problems since. 4 stars only critique is content quanitity is limited. Great sci-fi and every once in a while a good blockbuster. Wife and daughter rarely watch this with me but I like it."
Drake Fuerst,A lot of shows Even though there is Adds It's still pretty good
amanda zabala,"So I'm editing my original review paramount has not gotten even worse and my husband has tried your "" trouble shooting"" tips clearly don't work video playback sucks so bad, constantly freezes, kicks you out of the app completely. I'm wasting money paying for this Im so tempted to just get rid of it. I also hope they don't blame my Internet connection next. Just take accountability for your app not being as good as it started out."
Kirk Taylor,"Zero stars. What a pile of garbage. And god forbid you have to interact with their support personnel (you will have to, unfortunately, because the app and this service are just that awful). This turd will be used as an example to show future generations that horrible design and execution can kill an app and its surrounding business. And 2024 will assuredly be the end of Paramount+ as it will be folded into some other company's mess. There will be no 2025 for a Paramount+. Mark these words."
Joe Ybarra,"This app in on my Google tv constantly crashes, and even sometimes won't load, gives an error of ""something went wrong."" Please update/ fix this app. Edit: I've done what stated for your reply. This doesn't help, I've even cleared the cache of the app. Still crashes randomly, but notice all the same complaints. This app needs to be fixed, and the developer needs to be notified of all the same issues..."
Chris Cammarata,This is the buggiest streaming app on multiple devices. No improvements have been made.
Ronald Baker,"The app doesn't resume where you left off most of the time. Sometimes, the video locks up, and trying to reverse or forward will notnget the video to play, so if you exit the show and then go back into it, it restarts the video from the beginning and requiring you watch a ads before fast forwarding back to where you left off, and then you have to watch ads again."
Aldo Cruz,That's why it is free with the WALMART subscription. I can't even watch a movie
Puck,I cannot even get into it. I had an account linked with Prime but I dropped Prime. I just want the paramount channel. I log in and just tells me to check my wifi which is fine. So how do I fix this. It's not my equipment. It's your app. Your owned by CBS. DO BETTER!
anthony castillo,App is glitchy when I pause then restart the pause page info remains on the screen or if I stop watching it goes back to a part of the video I already watch 20 to 30 minutes ago
Drea N,"freezes, boots me out, restarts episode on its own. an hour episode takes me 3 hours to watch with how scrappy this app is. will be canceling my subscription. not worth paying for it"
Shortie C Bee,Has a little trouble loading on my TV sometimes. But it's a great app. Lots and lots of really good options.
Jacob Toews,so many ads
Rachel Gleaves,"We had an ongoing issue with our tv not streaming parmount+ live and did chat with care however we ended up calling them and got a wonderful rep who was able to resolve both issues we were having ( TV and my phone app) it was fast and efficient and we are very pleased with the results. Thank you for taking care of our issues as it was very frustrating, and we were thinking about canceling because it was not working. Rep was very knowledgeable and professional."
June Watson,Have this on my tv and it freezes all the time and when you restart the episode it makes you watch a bunch of ads again before you can pick up where you were and it just sucks
Sierra Henderson,Has a lot of my favorite shows !
George Maldonado,Not that many showa to wacth. Don't get me wrong there's about 20-35 giid shows after that there's nothing else ti watch.
Samantha Luse,Love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lucinda,Picks and chooses when it will let me watch shows on cbs. Had a problem and it finally started working now its doing the same thing again. We all have the exact same phone and it works on everyone else's phones and tvs bit mine. Nothing is wrong with my phone I've had it checked. It's the app.
Cindy Flores,It's not working on my phone
Charito Holbrook,Does not give what it promises regarding shows
Matthew King,Problems with downloads recently.
Colby Bauer,"It's so-so. I got it free for a month along with Walmart+ with a calling card purchase. It sucks that I can't watch some of the Showtime stuff, and the movie/TV listings need to have a better search, and browsing, feature. UX need work for sure. There are dozens of movies that are not on Paramount+, which is also kind of lame. I won't subscribe after the free month runs out tomorrow."
Molly Snyder,Favorite streaming app
Kelly Harris,It crashes and locks up all the time. I am extremely disappointed with the channel overall.
Blake Brown,"Can not watch any show. The app stops working, locks up, or boots you out. Does not matter what you do to fix the issue it does not work. Don't waste your time or money o. This app, since Paramount+ does not care if it works, all they care about is money. Fix the app or refund everyone."
Alkami,More money but also more shows and more choice. Higher price and higher value should go hand in hand. Steady As She Goes but don't get greedy. Hit it!
Lisa Marie,No complaints I love it
MFrederick Butler,Great app for screeming
L. Hope Hutchinson-Elias,üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ
L. G. de C.,"I love watching shows and movies on the Paramount app on my Samsung Galaxy Android. My current complaint is that the introductory screen animation/logo remains for far too long...so long that sometimes I give up and close the app to do something else. It never gets to the Who's Watching screen. When it does... I feel lucky. I've tried restarting and I've tried closing out of the app and going back in, but that doesn't work either. :("
Albz James,Enjoiiable...thumbz up
michael washington,Paramount us worth having.
Tyler Shearer,Pretty good selection of TV shows and movies. And I like how I pay a little extra for no ads and that means no ads. I used to have Hulu no ads but I would still get ads all the time. Glad I switched!
Emily Brasher,Variety of choices of shows and movies. App runs smoothly
Shannon,"For the most part, this app isn't terrible. I do get more error messages while it than any other streaming service I have tho. Half the time there's an ad when the show comes back on it starts playing at the spot the pervious ad left off on so I have to fast forward to where I was or rewatch what i literally just watched. All of this is bad enough, but I just resubscribed 2 weeks ago and they're already trying to charge my card for next month when I have 2 weeks of service left."
Magdalena Gonzalaz,Bad
Ash Daignault,Love it
Jami Echeverri,"Hope you like commercials/ads. I got a free trial and figured I could give it a try. You're all but bullied into the ""premium"" subscription because they cram so many ads into it. Unfortunately just not worth it for us considering how many streaming services there are that don't include commercials every 3-5 minutes."
Yolanda Silva,Best app out there right now
Greg Yturralde,Awesome movies like 1883 and 1923 and many more enjoy them all
Ryan McWilliams,I can't even get the app to open anymore. I am a huge fan of the content. I just can't watch it. This has been the same with my two last phones. Clearing the cache and or restarting the phone does nothing. Apps should work. Just saying.
Miguel Lomeli,good
Danny Johnson,Great
Marina Rodriguez-Moya,"The app works great, it doesn‚Äôt crash."
cesar portillo,Awesome
nicholas schutt,loving the options of shows available
Jeremy Fisher,Easy to use live long and prosper
Dwayne ‚ÄúDainn‚Äù Preisser,Disappointed that in order to manage my account on my phone I need to delete the app because pulling up the website automatically redirects you onto the app which doesn't allow account management
Jeffery Kardaras,This app is trash. I can log into it but I can't connect it to my TV and it's only allowing me to watch the free stuff.
Brady Aiello,"I cannot open this app, at least not the normal way. Every time I click the icon, it shows the Paramount animation, and then just freezes. Literally 100% of the time. However, if I open Paramount Plus in my browser, and then select, ""Open in App"", it will open the app correctly. Thank god for deep links I guess."
Joy Ziola,Love this app. Any problems with it there customer service is quick to help.
Joshua Deatherage,"I have two issues... #1 How can you not keep the Star Trek movies on your streaming service? I mean, Star Trek is owned by Paramount it shouldn't be that difficult. It's extremely frustrating. The whole reason I got Paramount+ was to watch Star Trek. #2 You guys have got to fix the brightness settings on your streaming service. Because it starts getting brighter and then darker at random times whenever I'm watching something, it's really annoying"
Cassandra Pastrimas,Keeps crashing!! Won't even open on my fire TV. Why charge for something that doesn't work!!! Ugh I'm so mad!
Andrew Fischer,"Edit.. if you have my phone, set your screen time out to 10 minutes. Launch the app and wait 6 minutes, then it works! App on Galaxy S20FE doesn't work at all. Worked fine a month ago now freezes on the opening blue paramount screen. Tried deleting cashe, force close, uninstall/reinstall. Even went to their customer service, no luck at all. If it didn't work on my 8 year old Samsung TV I would cancel my subscription."
Megan Martinez,Way too many ads for 8 dollars a month. Not worth it
Diane Beale,Works great on my phone!
thomas stewart,Was working fine now don't stream past fist set of Comercials
Steven Bloxsom,It's a great app. I get to watch a lot of shows movies and lives tv
joe brennan,An awsome app to enjoy the shows I like and can watch them on my own time. Thanks CBS and Paramount
Donna Minder,"Great programming, but your app mostly sucks. I stream all the apps and your's is by far the one with the most glitches. For example, after every commercial it backs up to either the last ad or mid-way. Fortunately, it doesn't make me rewatch the ad and does allow me to continue the program with adjustment, but this is SUPER irritating."
mpredosin,Downloads take up way too much space. I choose Standard Definition for Downloads in Settings but still 13 episodes took 61 GB. On Netflix 24 episodes only too 4 GB of space. The Paramount Plus must not be respecting the Download setting and downloading High definition.
Ernest Skiba,"Still Disappointing! I added Paramount + with Showtime on my YouTube TV to watch Star Trek Discovery and other shows and it looks like you can't watch then on YouTube TV until following week. Also there is no way to just login to Paramount+ as a third party with YouTube TV membership ...but your website offers it for Hulu, DirecTV, and Spectrum... that's interesting üëéüëé Cancelled it."
darryl whitfield,Best content üëå
"justo i. toves, jr.",I like the many selections of shows and movies.
Darren Burnham,All my favorite shows in one place.
John St Lawrence,"Audio clicking, have to reload every 5 minutes. Shuttle controls are too small to navigate. 2nd review: SEVEN YEARS LATER, IT HASN'T GOTTEN ANY BETTER WHAT THE HELL US GOING ON?"
Marlin Hernandez,I'm happy with my shows and sports.
Ron Cain,They have a lot that I like!!!!
Eric Avalos,This it's starting to give alot of issues. It's always telling text issues
Moe Sizlak,Really enjoy this app and it's content. The mobile app works far better than the TV and Fire stick versions.
Yvette Crawford,I Love This App I can watch my TV shows and movies
Aage B,Good
Timothy Dale,Great shows/movies and my favorite go to streaming app.
Key,Quality content. The release of Elsbeth made me squeal. The spinoff I didn't know I needed.
Maria Guifarro,On my phone is great but on my TV it says not available in this region
Henry Joseph,"For me, most reliable streaming app!"
Kayla Bays,Love paramount plus! I can watch all the shows I grew up watching like rokos modern life and the rugrats and many more. So if you can absolutely get it I promise it's worth more!!!!!!!
Telepathy,The Statue of Liberty
None Ya,"Tired of it choosing what i can play and replay, i am tired of being able to play the episode before and after the one id like to replay. No option to restart, just buffer and prompt next episode, not the only time this has happened."
Angel Bennett,Nice Job Angel Bennett
M. Lucy Rivera,Not helpful
Ib Today,So far my experience with pyramid has been fantastic
keoki kekaula,App works way better now.
Delores Milton,I love Paramount + AWESOME!!
Bob Ewing,This app has everything I like to watch!
Tony Anderson,"Just like t.v., only smaller."
brandon gray,"This app is a nightmare on all platforms, freezes all the time, doesn't track your previous viewing, takes forever to load, the list goes on and on, just about anything that does go wrong on a app it does in this one"
Cody Meador,"The ads are absolutely ridiculous! Within 5 minutes, it went to a commercial break 5 times with 4 ads during each break. It also does not keep up with what I've already watched. It keeps trying to get me to finish an episode I finished 3 seasons ago. Don't know what's been going on, but I certainly hope it gets better soon. Far too many options out there to keep dealing with nonsense."
Illinois Sm,Sometimes stop working.
Shon Parker,"Horrible App on Firestick The app is slow, buggy and hangs ALOT!! VERY inefficient programming. Right now you can't even see individual episodes of a series without the app freezing or simply not respond to remote clicks. Programmers should be fired!! Lift the covers, and a quick look at the code would most likely scare any REAL programmer!!"
Eric MacLaurin,"This app is so bad I'm actually embarrassed for everyone at the company. Do people there use the app or just not care? Specifics as requested - 1. Dont ask for details if editing my comment and a 500 letter limit is all I can provide. You aren't testing your app in lower bandwidth situations. Lately I can't even play downloaded episodes. Most download requests also just disappear. Instead of a click to download a season, I have to click every episode & most never download. Etc etc."
James Houska,Great App! Plenty of choices!
Christian Aragon,I like it
Wayne Hayes,"I do enjoy the App that I pay for however the commercials are a real sticking point for me. I pay to use this app. I don't want commercials. So I got a reply stating in a nutshell, ""Pay more, and we'll take out the commercials."""
Terry Fay,Mind
Daron B,This app shows movies and TV shows too dark on my Android. I'm canceling this subscription solely for this reason
Jerome Holman,Great app but wish it had support for full screen and responsive layout on Pixel Fold and Android tablets!
joe mc,Great app
Kevin Burgess,They do not allow you to cancel
Chris Fournier,"Love this set of content very much - but the app needs work. I can see we all have similar issues. Opening the app on FireTV or Chromecast will likely take 2 or 3 attempts. Once in, starting a show has a bit less than 50% chance of success the first time. Even going from one episode to another in the same series fails a lot. But I need to watch Star Trek :) moving to one star now for that ai bot response below"
Peter Phuc Phan (Peter Phan),Horrible user interface.
Scout pack,It is great I can watch some of the shows from my childhood u should download it and it will remain u of your childhood
Joseph Meyer,Since update can not open app. It goes to the load screen and stops there.
Tyra Ramsey,"This app is HORRIBLE!! I can't get through a show without it freezing at least 3-5 times, or the dialog and the picture are out of sync. PLEASE FIX IT!!!!"
Artisan Dragon,"Having a good time with it, it has lots of good shows I love :) i get kicked out of the app sometimes, but all apps have those issues. Not a big deal for me."
Barbara Miller,"Loving it, best movies, and up to date TV shows."
Andrianne Walker,IAM not impressed I want cancel ‚úñÔ∏è my subscription thanks
Nicholas Richter,Will not allow me to watch on my mobile device. Keeps telling me that everything is not available even when I'm hooked up to Wi-Fi
Joshua Petersen,"Halo is trash and so is paramount plus, delete app un sub."
rebel girl,Y'all have all the south park movies why not the south park tv show
Grissel Hernandez Diaz,Love paramount + ‚ù§Ô∏è has the best series and movies for the monthly price. it's even lower than Netflix or any other app ... did I already tell you how much i love this network ? üòç
Wendy Cosby,This is my favorite app for the programming it has but it's so buggy on the firestick I can't watch it. It randomly shuts off saying it can't connect to the internet. Sometimes I'll be able to hear the show but can't see it. It's so frustrating. None of the other apps do this just Paramount and it's only happening on the firestick. If the bugs were fixed I'd give it 5 stars.
Franci Pants,After 4 days of my free 7 day trial I was finally able to download the app. Now it constantly buffers and yes I have great service! Cancelling my subscription!
Hot Toddie,Enjoyable
Roderiks' World,Added commercials......üëé
Cyndy Valle,The app glitches almost every time.
Sharon Watson,This app sucks because it makes it so hard to unsubscribe when you're tired of looking at it
Nancy gerdes,"I am extremely happy with the app, And Paramount plus I really enjoyed it."
Theresa Phillips,I enjoy paramount+ at home on my TV. But I havent been able to open the mobile app for a few months. The Paramount logo stays on my screen until I get frustrated and close it.
Ryan Didier,Update....if I could go to zero stars I would. There's always buffering or technical difficulties or force closes. No other streaming service seems to offer those 3 options currently so bravo to you guys for that.
Jacoby Stephenson,Love it
Storm Broker,Amazing
Enrique Cuevas,Esta bien pero no tiene ningun show o pelicula trasducidas en espa√±ol latino

David Zavala,Great app 100
Anita May,Has great movies!

Louisa Duchemin,Having this ability to catch up on my shows while traveling is great!
Karen Sengstock,Very good
Tony Gunn,I love Star Trek and I Will continue to use Paramount as long as I can Trek the Stars with them.
Clarissa Duran,It is not allowing the provider login on the app. Please fix.
Ruth Goldberg,"Like so many other subscribers who have left a review, I regret paying for a full year subscription. I cannot watch an entire movie or series episode without repeated crashes followed by Error 3005. After troubleshooting and speaking with Customer Service (A real person promptly answered both times - Good Job!) the problem persists. Very disappointed. Won't recommend to others."
Personalstorm,Everything works smoothly. Enjoy watching TV whenever the mood hits me. And very affordable.
Long nguyen,Hello good app love it
Haylie Ann,I can never get this app to load my TV shows all I ever want to do is watch SpongeBob wherever whenever and it quite literally never loads. Instead it either shows a loading screen forever or says there was an error but usually it's the spinning wheel that never loads üëé
Mireya Ochoa Olivas,Love the shows just with there were more seasons
Victor Ortiz,"This application is pure garbage. It says that runs since androind 5.0 and up, but it does not execute in my devise that has Android 11. I feel cheated becuase neither my tablet that has Android 12 can run it. I select one star because I cannot select zero stars."
Brett Profitt,"This app barely works on any device and the service itself shows ads no matter the tier (they call them ""promotional interruptions""). The weird PR heavy AI sounding responses to all the reviews also really don't make a good impression."
Heidi Loveland,"you say the next episodes for ""Ghosts"" premiere on Thursdays are not always true....I look for it on that day and it is not available for the new episode.... Same thing with ""Tracker"", on Sunday's... never always a new episode..???? whiskey tango foxtrot?? why is that so? why am I told I can watch next episode on the Thirsday or Sunday of the next week and not so???!! I can get people to lie to me for free!!@!! I mind you charging me for the lies... still tonight no new ""Ghosts"" episode.. y lie?"
Christin,"STILL the WORST streaming. . . ANYWHERE. But don't worry, Paramount won't waste any of our subscription money actually fixing the issue. They have ""step-by-step trouble shooting techniques."" Other apps have commercials & NEVER crash. Paramount+ is setting new standards. At the end of the 120-second commercial break. . . Death. . . Black screen. . . App must be restarted. Then, it will resume the show and start at the beginning of the commercial break so you don't miss a millisecond of ads. üôÑ"
Adrian Vera,Descriptive audio is stuck on some films and is unable to change to normal audio. Such as Mission Impossible one.
Chase Allen,"Unskippable commercials. At least it works better than their website and TV app, although that's not saying much."
Charlie Robinson (C-LandBoom),Love it
Jerome Fuller,Is the best app can I have used and I enjoyed it very much
Dusty Cline,Great shows and movies but not everything I was wanting to watch. But still I would recommend it to anyone.
Jorge Pedroza,Awesome
E.raine Gootee,glitchy
James Merola,"App is fine, but I only use it because their TV application crashes constantly."
Amanda Buchanan,"Terrible connection! I tried using this app on multiple devices and it keeps glitching. Makes watching a show unbearable. Uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared the cache and forced stopped. Nothing fixes it. Just terrible."
Steven Creek,"The app buffers every few minutes for unknown reasons. I've checked my connection, reinstalled the app, and the tv is not old at all. This doesn't occur in any other streaming platform. So, it must be an issue with this streaming platform specifically. Also, every other thing i try to watch has an error code and will not play. Update: followed all the troubleshooting for LG tv it reduced the buffering and interruptions briefly. Shortly after it resumed with all lagging and stopping."
William Norton,It always says something like 'video playback' or something like that and it just cut right off my show and won't let me watch it again HORRIBLE! The updates are horrible too at first I could watch all my shows fine but now it is black and cuts me off! I m still surprised that people still use this app!
Michael Lohss,"Well, with the latest update, it's still the Worst app ever! We like the shows, but each time we start a show, it pauses on the ad , and then I need to start over starts over with a damn beginning ad, and the show started over. For the chat bot responding to these reviews, the app sucks! Fix your problems."
Jeremy,Update 4/4/24: Still like this...ugh. I like Paramount plus the service but the app isn't good. For one thing there is an annoying white bar/pull down log that constantly sits on the Fullscreen playback. Why? It does nothing. Can't I watch something Fullscreen? I want NO bars/logos! Can someone please help?
Dave Seymour,The app is awful. Can't even make it to the login page.
A Pratt,This app keeps hanging at the splash screen and will not open. I've installed and uninstalled several times with the same problem.
Chris Pointer,Love this app
Samantha Cervantes,By far my favorite app
Alexander Amicucci,"The commercial breaks would be more tolerable if they weren't so jarring. Edit it after the scene, not after a new one starts."
MBM,"Not bad, probably the only problem is after a commercial, the program, goes back around 5 minutes before the commercial started. FRUSTRATING..."
Juan Madrigal,When I pause it to do something else on my S23 plus the phone acts up and shuts down. My phone has never done this before ever. I did it a few more times and the phone keeps shutting down. Pleaae fix
Matthew Hicks,I like the choice of shows but for some reason it deletes my watch history if I haven't watched something for a while.
Lizbeth Cornejo,i purshased a 11.99 subscription and it charged my card and wont let me go in. and it wont me watch anything. Its making me pay again even tho i already paid. it already charged my card the 1st time
April Muller,"Impossible to unsubscribe, and not because it's a good service. It literally did not have an option in my account to unsubscribe. I had to go through a whole other site and get that to breakup with paramount for me."
Elle J,"I'm enjoying the Paramount+ app. I appreciate that it offers both oldies like Perry Mason and King of Queens, as well as newer original shows. While I've had troublesome glitches with other streaming apps (e,g. Amazon Prime, Freevee, and PlutoTV) this app hasn't given me any problems so far. I hope they soon add Murder, She Wrote to their list of available shows."
Tiffany Stillwell,Love it
Gayla Cox,This is really easy to use. I've never been happier. I have never had any trouble with it.
chris fitzsimmons,"Worst streaming app out there. Constantly crashes. Using it on a game system is almost impossible because of how slow the UI is. Don't try rewinding or fast forwarding because that might cause it to crash, or even trigger another set of ads, even if you just watched a full set... they have a bunch of great stuff on the app, but the app itself makes it not worth it. Just pirate what you want to watch instead."
Melissa Trader,I've uninstalled and reinstalled it several times I cannot get this app to run
Casa Nova,Double their price with no justification since they started and no additional contact really. Make it very very difficult for no reason to delete your keep watching content you should be able to do it from your phone or any way you're actually watching it from an Xbox or anything. And it has the worst brightness ever listen to my phone if I say turn up the brightness or put some settings inside of the app for brightness because God I can't see it but I can turn on YouTube and see it just fine
KPL Rule,Will not work..technical difficulties
Mele Ozuna,"It's improved a lot, Great app"
Jermaine Gresham,Great experience
Michael Simmons,Keep getting the run around trying to cancel my subscription!!!
Bryan Fannin (Bryan),"Worst steaming service by far. The amount of ads is absurd. I get this for free and still refuse to watch it. Zero stars. Edit: Yes I'm familiar with your ""ad free"" that still contains ads... Hard pass. I'll use Tubi that is completely free and has far less intrusive ads. The fact that you have a paid service that has so many ads is just ridiculous."
Jose Esparza,There are too many darn commercials. I prefer to just download what I need to watch or stream it on a website.
Bella Lena,This app does not work correctly. It always turning off and on in the middle of a movie.
Cassandra Franco,"Works well on my phone but not on my fire stick or Ruku. Doesn't load when I try it on my fire stick, I just get a blue screen. Works fine when I watch it on my phone."
Travis Sinclair,"idk if this is the same app on my roku TV but the app on my roku TV keeps crashing and the app is up to date, works fine on my phone tho"
Jessica Mcpherson-Dailey,"I'd be great with my free deal with spectrum, but I also got charged as well. I need a refund of my money.."
Gregg Blakesley,Your app is TERRIBLE!
Angel Santiago,Good Programing.
A M,"Connectivity on my TV is garbage. I have to restart the app on my TV over, and over again, to get through a one hour program. It'll just stop. When I restart my TV, I open the app and it tells me that their having ""technical issues"". I have to restart it again to get it to work. I do not have this issue on my phone, and they're both on the same internet. *Edit* Their ""troubleshooting"" guide is a joke. Clearing the cache and force-stopping and restarting the app... Did that. Doesn't help."
Fkn MEZR,"Best app, could be a little faster but overall GREATT"
Matthew Harmon,Sonic!!!
Deborah Joiner,"Cannot watch any program in its entirety because the app freezes at the commercial break. I am beginning to believe this by design to encourage subscribers to purchase the ""No Ads"" app."
jerry ehman,I love this app works well
Danielle Scala,Love this app
Belinda castro,Amazingly good
Erik Rasmussen,"The app doesn't work. You can't watch videos, they don't load. I've actually Uninstalled it fromvmy phone it's so useless. Love star trek but it's not worth a non-functioning app taking up space. 0 stars."
Joshua Leubner,Something happened in the last couple days. I watch on my Google pixel 8 pro. For some reason all videos are dark and unenjoyable to watch. Have tried everything to fix
John Garmon,Very satisfied; free with Walmart+
Susan,It is an absolutely amazing app my kids love it
Eric Anderson,"My main TV service. The last update fixed the problem I was having, thanks devotion! I gave the 5th star back."
Elliott Coonsis,Noice
ardivision,Always stops
Ted W Morris,"Time sensitive viewers will love this app! Quick to startup, easy to use!"
john conner,"Only way to use paramount but the player part of it is garbage. Sometimes you have to watch the same commercials twice. Most of the time the app loses your place in the show, so after commercials you might be closer to the beginning of show or skipped ahead to the middle. Sometimes it keeps playing adds or show and you can't forward rewind or pause."
Joseph Jordan,Nice shows.
LaKicia A. Butler,Can catch up on all my favorite shows whenever I like.
Sportszilla,Great app
Sarah Stofen,Wouldn't not let me watch anything on my phone or tablet. Waste of time. Only way I can watch it is on the roku.
Paula Mineo,"Exciting shows, great visuals, and shows I've never seen before, that I'm really enjoying."
Jeremy,Great for the price. I'm very happy. Only lost a few stars due to holding back on certain movies. Whole transformers franchise but they don't have revenge of the fallen it sucks cuz he want to watch it and chronological what are you can't.
Gregory Haines,The App is absolutely the worst app I have ever used I would give zero stars if I could
Jess Morrison,Great
Phillip Craig,üéáüéÜüòéüéáüéÜüéÜ‚ú®‚≠ê‚≠êüéáüéáüòéüòé Awesome
SHAWN P. MILLER,ü§òüî•ü§™
David C,Great movies and shows when it works lately paramount don't want to load or tells me sorry we are experiencing technical difficulties
Jacob Kaiser,"Missing a lot of content that it should. Very unstable, crashes expected. When they say ad free, they lied, it's just ads for cbs."
Paralysis By Analysis,App won't even get past the splash screen on my Android.
Ethan Petzinger,"God awful. One movie, transformers took up 26gb... what did I even just download."
Jon,Amazing App
Anna Mc,Great shows has about everything and also continues to put new episodes on. You don't have to watch some here then get another app to watch the rest and it's very affordable
Sarah Ehrman,"Keeps skipping to the ends of episodes so I can only watch the credits unless I rewind it myself, extremely annoying"
Daniel Olvera,Awesome
connie byrne,Can't manage acct through app on Android phone. Instructions on app for acct management directs me to website. Tornado activity in the Greater Cincinnati area Tuesday 4/2/2024 may be reason my bedroom tv is asking me to login when I click on my LG TV but can't change password I forgot via said TV and I'm not able to figure out app instructions on my phone app to manage my acct via website Paramountplus.c/account or it's instructions to manage via Google Play Store. Visio TV works!
Amanda Bell,Fantastic!
Shawnna Barker,I've noticed it glitches a lot and sometimes the subtitles don't match up with the audio but other than that the app is great and I get to rewatch some of my favorite cartoons from when I was a kid
Dawn Slosson,It won't open up on my phone!!!!
Herschell Gentry,I like the app. But I wish it had easy access volume control. Also it would be great if you could access the actors' information. All without going to a different app. This doesn't take away from the fact that this app is very enjoyable . I am very happy with it and watch it every day.
Alexander Stroud,Love em
Stephen McBride,Awesome selection
Latasha McCarson Martinez,"Love using this app, the cost is good for the service and what you get"
TheKing Cokner,ü•™üéâü•≥üéÇ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§´
Felicia Jenkins,Love the service. Wish there were less commercials.
Lori Jean,"Love this app, so many shows I want to watch are on this app. Ghosts is one of my favorite to watch, just waiting on the rest of the episodes!"
Scotty Knows,"Good app, just unable to switch plans which customer service can't fix"
Josephine Jenkins,Enjoy the selection of things to scream
ashley lee,( no stars honestly)ughh why pay again for my service still not to work and da trouble shooting step by step don't work either no real 24 hours hotline for help jus robots that instantly close the chat
Margo,I'm finally enjoying movies on my phone that doesn't freeze or break up.
Aaron Rivas,screen goes dark when watching halo...
Jonathan Look,"App refused to open, and gave the ""something went wrong"" error with the option to ""cancel"" or ""retry"". Updated the app, and the error now seems to be gone. Otherwise, when the app works, it's fine for keeping the kiddo occupied on the go."
Kathrine Brown,"It freezes all the time, I don't know what to do about it, none of my other apps do this so it's not my TV or my Internet. Edit: No it did not correct the issue. It's not just mine, it's a lot of people. It's all over the reviews."
Sovereign Now,Worst app on my Xbox. Extremely unresponsive.
Chase Sorenson,"This app is filled with errors. Nothing in my download que and it says que full. Sometime will not even open, just get an error that says try later."
Corey Zubia,It's been a lot better lately. No problems to note.
Jacob's Empire,Not working
Tyler Stevens,"This app just doesn't work on my pixel 8, crashes every time it opens. Tried to uninstall and reinstall and same problem."
Veronica Morey,Good TV shows.
Kayla,Love it...
Charles Danner,"Movies are old, not many new ones added but the price isn't bad."
Dan Spencer,This is one of my favorite services ever.
bigl723,Terrible. Foreign translation removed form some movies so now i have to assume what they said. I have ads even though I paid for no ads. Just terrible
Randy Hunt,"Customer service is non-existent. Do not use app. Easily scammed because of no support. The most difficult streaming app to make changes on because lack of support. Impossible to speak with person. If you have an issue your screwed, literally. Avoid at all cost. Read reviews before getting this hideous app from hell. 75% are 1 star and that's only because it's the least you can apply. This is by far the worse streaming app available. Peacock obviously could care less because the do nothing for i"
Lisa,Soo slow. Constant buffering. Often wont load and just goes back to the home screen. I find this same issue across the different devices i use. Not an internet issue as all other apps work fine
Ren Ruggiero,"Constantly buffering on my Google TV, then switched to Spanish audio randomly. I don't have these issues with other streaming services."
Eric Monroe,great content for a reasonable price
Stuart Cochran,motocross supercross and the rest is a bonus
Kindra Berglin,"Freezes, glitchy, forces closed, stops randomly, buffering issues, lags when scrolling, boring library, have to manually turn off audio description and subtitles for EVERY episode! Why am I paying $12 for this BS? You are charging more than Hulu and your service isn't even subpar, it's deplorable! You should be ashamed, greed is a sin and I hope Karma kicks your asses! Why doesn't my damn list load the entire contents!? Ugh!"
Lindsay Raglin,where is the option to cast to tv
david bozenski,"Randomly jumps scenes, freezes up and overall just stinks now. I don't know what happened, but fix it!"
Jacelyn Yonkees,"Says it's free and yhen steers upu to paid ""Plans"""
Mitch Wyant,Not quite what the trailer suggested
Christopher R. Paquette,Cancel already paid !!
Caseys_si,laggy videos
Wayne Wilson,"Use the app on Google TV and Firestick. I generally like the content. Too often, when opening the app, I get a picture of a kitten with a message saying there is a problem. At other times, when I choose a show, it will attempt to open only yo come back to the show selection menu. UI is nice, but the app is way too buggy."
Francis Sybeldon,Way to hard to cancel your subscription or just stall for short time
T B,love it
James Krepton,I am happy with it
Aubrey Redding,"Don't recommend! There is no customer service line. Good luck getting problems you're experiencing solved! The only customer service is available through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and a bunk phone number. The app is super glitchy, I've had to uninstall and reinstall multiple times due to the app purely not working, even though it's run fine before on the exact same phones? Now, I can't even download anything.. what am I paying for exactly? Oh that's right, a scam!!!"
Pamela Ross,"Just signed up for Peacock. I read the reviews, and I am not sure if I will be happy. I will watch and make a decision next month after viewing, whether I continue or cancel."
Sametta Williams,"I love Peacock!!! I watch it everyday. I can honestly say, for me, this is the best streaming app!"
Colvin Bobby,I love it‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüíØüëçüèª
Jennah Mendieta,"This app sucks so bad, crashes constantly"
Taylor Montgomery,wish it had PIP like YouTube so you could watch while you're doing other stuff on your phone
Shelly Madrigal,never works right ughh
Danielle Blackwood,I like Real Housewives and Luther. there are some other good programs on there. I don't watch tv anymore It's nice to choose select shows to watch.
Leah Desser,love Chicago PD
Thelaka Clark,app needs work. I should be able to turn off auto play. I should also be able to delete things from continue watching. these are basics
Angelique Files,I love love love peacock.
Kaila V,Try to play a show/ movie I left off on and peacock decides to play the following episode/ whatever it wants.. app is up to date.. really annoying
Crystal Marie,"I gave this app a 4-star rating because although I think it's a good app & it has many of my true crime shows, I watch on it, which I love! For some reason, after I've been watching my shows for a while & exit the app, my phone starts to act up & not function properly & I don't understand why. That is why I gave a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating."
Jacob Buehner,"The app's UI and functionality feels very second-rate--like they rushed its development or cheaped out on the engineering budget. Play and pause can't be affected by external controls (headphones, smartwatch, etc.), the ads are clunky and force you to watch multiple if you want to skip through an episode, and the app often won't remember your place in an episode. Overall the experience is poor compared to other leading streaming services."
Rayna Thompson,Has lots more great content than I expected. I'm very pleased. We watch something on here almost every day now.
Gene Clinton,Not worth it
Angela Tindall,love peacock and cheaper monthly price
Cindy Dale,Awesome! There are so many options to Watch!
Linette Herrin,AWESOME FANTASTIC THANKS FOR EVERYTHING ‚ô•Ô∏è
Gaming Craft (Thundergod2720),Absolutely love peacock it has my childhood shows on it.
Sharon Walker,I have found so many great shows and movies to watch.
DARCY SCHMITZ,Love it especially now when we are finally going to ditch Comcast and their outrageous prices with peacock and their affordable price you won't miss out on NBCs shows and other perks
Cristina Perales,App on tablet is apparently not in the same region as the one on TV in the same room. No customer support.
Lei Zhuofan,"Ever subscribed for the Premier League, but cannot watch most hot games in the APP, scam trash!"
Steve Thieman,Peacock stream is I'm trying to watch it on my PS5...and can't...I paid for it
Nicole DiTullio,Love that the app can play while using other apps
v b,great shows and NO COMMERCIALS!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Jane Gutierrez,"I love the views, because if you missed a match you can replay it! thatsfantastic!"

Marquese Walker,Love TV I'm a fan of all TV programs
Carolyn Johnson,For some reason I can't get into peacock account
Philip Ivey,U make it harder to find cancelation part
Larry Butler,"Great service. I love WWE so I get all of the pay-per-views, plus my favorite shows are on here (Everybody Loves Raymond, King Of Queens, and that 70s Show). It also doesn't hurt that the Peacock originals are awesome."
Melissa Fidele,always having trouble buffer every 30 seconds!!! waste of time trying to watch a documentary.
Leo Venuti,Nothing but technical difficulties. Have it in my Vizio smart tv and also on my roku. It's always either buffering or the app freezes. I've tried everything. I ended up just canceling it altogether. Too much of a pain.
Manny Gonzalez,"Love the app and it's content. My only complaint is that it removes shows from my recent watched automatically before I finish the show itself. I then have to find the show and episode I was on, it's a bummer everytime. Other than that, great app."
bruce banner,Hate speech
elana martinez,"Great app, I'm also soo glad it's free and has free movies and I also love how they have so much good movies and shows to chose from for FREE. I 100% recommend this app if you want to watch free good movies or shows‚ù§‚ù§"
Liz Murphey,I'm only downloading the app so I can cancel it. I'm pissed that I have to do this but whatever. Okay so that didn't work. I had to log in through roku and do it on my phone. I hate these predatory streaming channels. Most boomers wouldn't be able to figure this out and these channels know that. It's really sad.
Pedro Dennis,"they should all be happy they don't work all they do is events,shop, and travel and look pretty all day I would love to be in their space I'll be grateful and thank God for the blessings he has given me so all the dysfunctional behaviors is uncalled for thank you NJ boy"
Void,Won't link with the instacart app for what I paid for
Shell Fifield,I like the TV shows that you had when I was a kid. I never had watched TV and until I came to Auburn Maine and now in New Auburn ME.
Ozark Ldy,"2024 UPDATE: Cost tripled from last month. It was worth the rare item I might watch at the previous price. Most certainly not at triple that when you're on a fixed disability income. 2022 Sorry an error occurred, every time I try to actually pay for premium service. Guess you have all the customers you want already"
Mick Frederes,Please cancel
EL ADJEI,Newly subscribed to this app and am finding it difficult to watch any lives periumship games
Keith Inman,"I would have stayed at a 5 star rating but it's a 3 now because it takes me an 2 hours to watch an hour and half,it keeps pausing on me.but the commercials play fine"
Crystal Wyatt,reasonably priced. decent selection of stuff to watch. live Hallmark channel
Edwin Stone,THE BLOODLINE ROMAN REIGNS ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è
Lyndsay Bullock,"If you minimize the screen, the app quits after one episode of a show. You have to make the screen full again before the episode ends for it to roll into the next one. Annoying glitch. The repetitive commercials are going to turn us all into sociopaths."
Kevin van Zanten,"I would like that I could delete things from ""continue watching""."
Zach Pollard,lags constantly and nothing to watch have more on my hard drive lol and that doesn't require the internet
Jermaine,I love watching peacocküòÉ

Quintin Washington Kelley Sr.,love this app
Crystal Bastin,I'd like to be able to remove items from my keep watching list.
Victoria Henderson,Great streaming service but need to fix the glitches. I also I thought you needed to be updated but it already has been so then I logged out a lot back in and refreshed and it still does it's the same thing. FIX THE PROBLEM.
bobby Lastname,the controls and menu are terrible.
FalloutKing78,It's the worst streaming app because almost every good show or movie requires that you have premium account all the developers care about is more money. Edit they still are trying to rip off people by only allowing you to see one or two free episodes of a show
Kenneth Ray Thames,"Doesn't diserve a rating .t This is my criticism of this application. I'm trying to post my opinion ,You're not letting me post it"
Ricardo Vega,"I canceled Disney, Hulu, and espn subscribed to this and made a mistake. I canceled the subscription and can't stand 1 minute of loading times why do these companies bother"
Justin Araba,"I subscribed to Premium Plus, which is supposed to be ad-free, but there's one certain movie that's supported by ads. This doesn't make any sense."
Joni Dickson,"Peacock offers the worst streaming service. The App crashes constantly on every TV we've installed it on - The audio crackles, the screen freezes - I get booted from the app and can't restart any show. Contacted customer service 3 times, they walk me through the same troubleshooting steps, which hasn't solved our issues. We have 6 other streaming services installed on our TV's with no issue. We've performed factory resets on TV's- replaced our internet. Tested speeds. The app is the issue"
Crystal Treaster,Great but takes a lot of time to load
Xavier Medrano,very good
Rodney Holloway,"4 years later after my first review reporting this having Android/Chromecast issues, it's still going on. Content has been blocked for days. Twitter/X full of complaints. Nobody cares. CSRs ask for deep level tech questions, you send screenshots and an hour later they just ask you again. They blame your wifi, you connect to another WiFi point, tell them it still doesn't work and they send a cancellation link. No interest in even reporting any of this as an issue. Stunningly incompetent."
Ami Cooke,"Nice to see you had the sense to make the app available to Chromebooks, again. Runs like it should, thank you."
Richard Clarke,I Like The Programing
Curtis Whitfield,"IT""S GREAT"
Michal,"They don't show all the premier League games when you purchase the subscription, anything on NBC sports or USA requires a cable subscription"

Whitney Smith,I want to be able to lock the screen.
J- bird,Don't love it don't hate it
Kevin Arnold,"Paid for the ad free subscription, but still seeing ads in places. No settings in the app at all, so can't disable ""features"" like auto play or the loud trailers they show while you're browsing. Sounds keeps going in and out on EPL broadcasts as well."
Timothy Gentile,my smart TV app hasn't connected in 2 days
Ashley Clark,"It will hardly ever play, not sure if anyone else has this problem."
TK RYWA,"Peacock is a great app! So many shows to watch! . . - ,"
Tim Tepedino,"I only have this for Supermotocross, I pay for the highest subscription and it's still filled with forced ads. It's so frustrating to pay for something ad still get ads. I'm out."
Stan McCraigie,Nice
H Mcmurry,Yellow circle spinning then error
HOTTNESS Coats,"Update review Doesn't work properly with wifi, I have to use my mobile data to stream or watch any shows or movies. A little inconvenient needs to be fixed but otherwise it's fine."
manny Villanueva,Commercials a little too long.
Courtney Weaver,Hotel Transylvania
V. Whitley,love peacock!!! you guys have to fix the glitches I pay for my services and sometimes and cannot watch TV
Alex Reyes,excellent
Brandon Cannon,not working
Jill Smiel Latreille,I don't want everyone seeing my things
Kat Bre,"At first, this app was pretty decent, and then it changed. I stopped using it and un-installed it. It's really not worth it."
Elizabeth Cunningham,"I enjoy Peacock ü¶ö and all that it has to offer, including the WWE programming and my show that I usually miss on the networks. They have good movies also. üé¨ üëç"
Robert C,"It's a good thing that it's not an expensive monthly charge for access to peacock premium. I only get it to watch the monster energy supercross and outdoor motocross. You think after so many years in the industry that NBC could figure out how to mix audio. I swear, every time I go to watch the pre-race, the audio is mixed terrible. Echoes like crazy and they miss the audio on so many of the races when they're interviewing riders. I can't stand NBC anymore, so left"
Lena Britt,Simply the best!!!
snicker doodle,"It's the Worst streaming app ever. Still, it does not save the series you are watching. There are still too many errors. It just stops playing. And errors when trying to add shows to My Stuff. Peacock needs to save the shows that you are watching. I watch something, come back to watch more episodes, and the show is not there anymore in the continue watching. So I have to find what I was watching again. Why aren't they saved? So infuriating!!!"
Jeremiah Hence,great
Linda Pineau,Love it big time it is the bestüíïü•∞üíïü•∞üíï
Jessica Farmer,"With this last update, anytime I open it, it says I don't have signal. Doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or have 5G. I can search shows but it doesn't show me where I left off, or show new shows or movies."
Holly Adams,"loading is taking tooooo long, or it doesn't load!"
C. Darwin,"The app won't load on my phone, at all. It just remains stuck on the logo splash screen. Uninstalling... EDIT: The developer's canned response doesn't help either. Therefore this ""app"", or waste of space to put it more accurately, stays off of my phone."
Andrew Gluvna,recommendations have zero to do with watch history and search sucks
Daryl Roberts,Prepared
Amberr Nicholson,Why do I still see commercials when I paid for no commercials subscription?
Debra *,I want my privacy back!
Jonathan R,"Navigation is awful. When you choose an episode, it goes to the next one, even though the episode chosen has never been watched. The show pages take forever to load. This app needs a lot of help."
Kevin Mullins (Murdock),"Love it, peacock has many choices to choose from."
Victoria Esposito,This app and ONLY this app consistently thinks I have no Internet connection. It's fine when it works but that's...seldom.
Anointed Ace,because you need auto play.
Patty Horn,"I have been streaming for 15 years now. it's came along way. peacocks prices are better than most. latest movies and current TV shows. I have a few different streaming channels I save money and better selection than cable TV. peacock has an amazing selection. I love below deck, Chicago fire great selection for movies,I have watched movies on peacock that where still in theaters. great channel"
Emili Williams,Still very buggy. Crashes and takes forever to load. Otherwise good.
Paolo Grilli,Good
JNMA,"Nbcsports and the rest of the nbc family were supposed to be available with peacock but even with a paid subscription that content is not on this app and requires a separate app making use limited. This app is improved but not as intuitive as netflix, max etc. to remove watched items and adjust settings."
Ifeanyi Patrick,"Totally excruciating, should have spent my money on a hamburger üò°üò°üò°. I wish I never subscribed, this app is so annoying"
Chris Wilson,"Limited selection of mostly B and C grade shows. Fine if you get it free, but a total rip-off if you have to pay for it."
scott ingram,POS app UI interface all of it is trash and everybody should be fired.
ANSELMO HEREDIA,always buffering
WillyGee13 ‚ÄúWillyGee13‚Äù,too Many commercials

Jim Novinc,Looks like the fixed the Android TV audio description bug!
caroline cox,Good story as long as u forget about following Biblical Noah.
Cedric Gaines,"unable to cast, uninstalled and reinstalled many times just to watch one show and it's not working at all"
Master Jedi 155,"I wouldn't even give this app 1 star man. The fact I'm sitting here trying to enjoy my steak and my night. It's absolutely gross I have too sit and here about a commercial called hims over and over again,more then anything. Itsgross man. I can't tell what I would tell to do about that okay. But I'm tellinguthis app is named peacock that should tell you right there. Evenwhen Iwasakid Ihada mean fpace big chin,now Iwill scareubackin your boots man.WWEmoveonfromthisapp.actually trash stop üö´üòàü´µüî•"
Robbi Flannagan,this does not stream well. I have a Sony TV. it constantly breaks up! I am about to get rid of it!!!
cstan1978,"YOUR ROKU APP IS HORRIBLE. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. CONSTANTLY FREEZING AND STARTING OVER. IT'S GETTING OLD. I KNOW YOU PROBABLY DON'T CARE, BUT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW."
Emi Castorena,Paying for a service that app is freezing the shows are crashing and all that gets said is we want to help and bugs are fixed but nothing gets fixed and I seen others comments I'm not the only one so i know it's not my device this is just sad especially given the fact how expensive streaming has become and I do pay the higher fees for no comerciales and still get the worst quality on the app if this isn't resolved before my next payment due date im done even if it means i miss my favorites
carolyn (Red),"Love my Law & Order Shows. L&O, SVU, OC ! Mariska is the Queen of all cop dramas... My man Eliot Stabler has to be on! SVU and OC MY FAVORITES ON PEACOCK"

wulfpac1,awesome really awesome
Lu,best network ever!
Gradie Roberson,excellent programming
Adam Agan,seems to push a woke narrative.
Making Changes,great moments
Mary Soria,Only service I pay for now. Super diverse content.
raelena Butcher,im getting so aggravated about how it NEVER resumes the movie or series from were you left off. it starts it back from the first. Everytime I try to fast forward it... it just freezes. This is happening on my PS4. It's like only way I can watch it on my living room TV.
Timothy Harp Jr,Great stuff on it üòÉ
James McGilley,Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus 5G android 14 UI 6.1
Angela Maddy,love watching my favs. ü¶ö is the best ever! no commercials is even better‚ù§Ô∏è
Sara Gushwa,Worst streaming app ever. Constantly crashes and bugs out. Then it will make you watch the same ad break over and over when it crashes and you try to resume. Freezes and kicks you out of your show regularly. If there was any other service to watch my favorite shows on I would never use peacock again. It has consistently sucked for literally years!
Alex Reed-devine,One of the top platforms With everything I watch
Lula Berry,great
John Boggs,love catching up on shows
Jimmy Jones,WrestleMania was off the chain
Commander Gorbon,won't install on Hisense Google tv
Tammy Nickaboine,I love it

SASHA LAWSON,The app will Not open..Now

Delilah Torres,keeps freezing
Mr. W!seguy,EMAILS GET NO RESPONSE FOR OVER 3 YEARS. NO VOLUME CONTROL WHILE CASTING ! LITERALLY ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS AS EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS BEEN COMPLAINING FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS
Dragons heart,love having easy access to aftershows & exclusives.
L H,"Worst streaming platform. No option to mark shows as not interested or did not like in order to remove from recommendations. Also it auto plays the next random show or movie if you do not click out of the credits fast enough, even if it is not in your queue. Then that random show or movie stays in your continue watching history. The only way to remove it is to manually fast forward to the end. You end up getting a bunch of trash recommended because you cannot customize anything."
David B2431,a great value in streaming
Sean ‚Äúflashg08‚Äù Perry,"Continue watching nonsense. If you accidentally click an episode of a show you don't want, it continuously shows up in the continue watching placeholder. The only way to get rid of this is to wait until the end of a show season. Ridiculous."
Michael Newman,Their coverage of the Master's is atrocious.
michele kelly,lots of great shows!
jasmine mccoy,love it
millan rivera,best app
Dale Fuller,Took my money and then tells me that it is not supported in my region. Peacock clearly in it for the money
Ben 2173,"Would be 5 stars, but Dolby vision, Atmos, and HDR never works on Google tv."
Rory Santistevan (Rory Martian),Free video is gr8!
Ray C,After your show finishes playing it starts another show you did not request to see. A show not on My Stuff list. Why? Just end and let me decide what I'd like to watch next.
Roo Hamm,I love itüòâ
Zepha Hester,"Y I'm giving 4 instead of 5 I speak English bur for some reason all my commercials are in Spanish which is crazy, I wish I can pay not to have any."
Yolanda Ruiz,Very nice
Gary Herman,"How about this? If it freezes like it does constantly, DON'T show me the commercials again! Not renewing."
Eliezer Ponce Jr,very good
Mr Black530,Crashes more often than it opens. Have to Uninstall and reinstall to update it. Easily one of the worst built apps I've seen in years.
Kelliann Brooks (Kellib420),I absolutely LOVE Peacock.
Renee Terrill,"Peacock is taking off part of my favorite show, Escape to the Chateau. No reason to keep the app if they do this. I watch this show daily. So I may have to cancel my subscription if this actually happens. This show is the only reason I started subscribing."
DaShelle E Cranker,I have problems with accessible access and viewing
Eliezer Munoz Rodriguea,Good xpirians
James Johnson,I really enjoyed the convenience. Cause I can watch t v wherever i'm at

Shane Odear,nice
Casey Christensen,So many great shows to watch on Peacock and it costs less then most.
Patricia Gomez,"I like it, it has great shows"
Adam Barnes,I love the shows but the service does not stream quick enough
Reggie Bates,"I love this app, but suddenly it has started telling me playback error I'm going to give it 30 days before I uninstall and cancel subscription unacceptable when I pay for something and can't use it"
Jeri White,we should be able to watch our shows the day they air not next say
Ellery,let me watch picture in picture! I want to watch while I text and browse other apps (like the mini YouTube app)
Judy Howe,If I wanted to pay to watch I would get Netflix or Hulu. Not this app. It don't have to much to offer. I got better apps to watch TV on for free
Angie L,love the options
jay chase,App keeps crashing and telling me.i need an active internet connection on my tablet...but yet works fine on my tv...what are we going to do to fix this issue?
Jadas World,"my app keeps glitching and stopping my streaming. I've restarted my phone, no new updates, getting annoying"
Scott Lefkowitz,Great app. Way to many ads.
Betty Warren,Excellent programming.
RoKCo33,Edit- working now thank you App wont open 4/6/24 the app just force closes. Galaxy note 8
Jamie Naughright,amazing
Maksym Katasonov,Their app needs work. It doesn't recall the last episode I watched nor where I left off in the episode. It usually sets me back several episodes when I exit out of the app.
jUSTIN nOPE,"Poorly developed app with constant streaming freezes on phone and roku. Not even worth the deal they gave me to try to keep me from canceling. Have your devs look at Pluto TV, Netflix or basically any other streaming app on the planet to find out how to make a show stream consistently. All the rest of them work fine."
Brian Linton,the app is usually great. But for some reason it's been crashing lately.
Hannah Elora,I'd really like this app more if it didn't get rid of ur continued watching. It only stays like 2 weeks. And also with how quickly it asks are u still watching it asks after 4 episodes of something and will turn off very quick. Really wish they'd change that.
Steve Settlemire,I can't replay wwe
Philip Berns,Constantly having issues while Casting. loose about 8 seconds of audio before commercial and last 8 or so at the end of a commercial
Kisi,Good
Roberto Ortiz,the best thing ever
Davon mcleod sr.,love the movies but need to be up to date with wrestling
Marc McConnaughy,Why am I paying for an app to watch ad's every 10 minutes. I can see an break every 30 minutes but this is a joke
Lucinda Lee Wilson Anderson,Love the channel when I can stream at&t is the worst for that.i need to find a carrier or provider that is Senior kind and has a good plan for so that we can play our games or stream a good movie att never even tried to fix the Wi-Fi problem guy came in said oops your phone line has been cut so I can't set u up for Internet or wifi.told me to try and go back to the provider I had previously...I was SOOO shocked I wanted to personally slap myself for chosing att.
Elizabeth Robinson,very difficult to access your list. wish it were easier to find the shows you're already watching. can't find setting to turn off auto play
Kenneth Tollor,Keeps e watching movies
Emily Skinner,love Peacock .... we dropped spectrum TV for yall ....
guadalupe rodriguez,Great content!
sarah ackerman,"I love this app, however I desperately need a skip all intros setting. Please üò≠üò≠"

Tessa,there is so much to watch
Torey Johnson,love it
David Honkus,"Well,it does freeze up quite a bit lately,but ,idk it has potential I guess."
J Baffi,Hi I am peacock premium user I pay $11.99 a month this is the second time in 2 months my local news has went out I am residing in Escanaba at the time now I get news from Wisconsin I left a review around a month ago it cleared up is this going to be an ongoing thing if so I think peacock premium users should get a discount that's one of the reasons why I pay $11.99 a month to watch my local news if there is something wrong with the app why can't you just come on there and tell us the app itself
Miles,this is the best $h!+. I have ever seen on television in a very long time!! I will be eating pizza and pies until the next season premiere's!
Chris Sargent,Won't load
Ernestine MAssey Clyburn,I never use
Fern Kaufman,Not having the ability to remove shows from continue watching and not being able to turn auto play off make me not use this app unless I have to. I have had the Peoples Choice Awards on my continue watching without any way to remove it. It says it's played and going to the end again doesn't remove it. There is a glitch and no one has fixed it.
Marie S.,Would not let me use the discount offered
Scott Smith,Constantly freezes and u gotta constantly reset your phone it's a waste of money filled With bugs with all the money NBC gets it should work good not like garbage now it's working better
Jessica Bobessica,"Almost unwatchable due 2 buffering. & yes, I obviously did EVERYTHING recomended by the app 2 minimize buffering eventho turning off internet access on all ur other devices is highly inconvenient. The fact that there r only 5 sections under the ""account"" or help area & 1 whole section is just 4 buffering probs, tht should tell u sumthin. Also u hafta go 2 the actual site 2 do anythin, like look at any account info beyond ur email & current plan & the app help section may as well not b there"
Mary B.,"A vast of movies, reality shows, and more."
Megan Chandler (Meg),sometimes it is slow to load other than that its fine
GAMER BOY 08,Great
Tamara Keller,can't watch wrestling and I paid for the upgrade
Angeleyes75,I did not order Peacock and I want refunded for every month I paid for. I don't even have Peacock installed on my phone.
John Ojeogwu,L O weüòçüòç
pktheviking,"Best streaming service out there. Between on-demand connect and live sports and entertainment, this app cannot be beat."
Isabella Sowell,I love peacock because I'm able to watch the mighty ones
Mr jeffrey,"It's annoying seeing nothing but liberal political adds. Also ever since I switched from no ads to ads the shows like start over right after watching causing you to watch the ad then realize after the 2 ads nope not the next episode. In fact, sometimes it will go back like 3 episodes. It's like peacock is trying to annoy me into getting the more expensive non ad service. I swear if the office was on any other platform I would delete this stupid app so quick"
Sonya Siles,"There's always an error,and a solely no customer service number"
Patrick clinton,"everyone should know how courageously they fight on land, sea and air"
Delon Smith,The only reason I keep it is because of The Office
Samuel Morado,very good content. Glad to subscribe
Michael Remlinger,Can't find hazbin hotel
Travis Rehder,Amazing app
Jaime Martinez,decent shows!!!
Rena Kerfoot,like this app. good stuff to watch for a good price
Dillon Flagg,Frustrating sign up designed to get you to ditch the free trial and buy it
Vanessa Crowe,"Used to be the best streaming service. Had minimal ads at well picked times. I didn't mind and it was perfect. But I can't even get through a whole scene without a scene, and some ads are just not appropriate. Some ads are only 30 seconds apart, others are 2 minutes from the last. Subtitles are on but don't work. I have to turn them off and on for each movie or episode. It makes buying the TV show and movies worth it on other streaming apps. Maybe DVD will make a comeback. Peacock do better."
Zemenar,love it
Robert Jackson,great ppv lots of movies. They put the E in entertainment
Char,"I don't know what the problem is with this app, but on EVERY SHOW at about 3/4's of the way through, the sound goes out, then it freezes. Sometimes you'll see that specific spot 2 or 3 times. It eventually goes back to the main menu and you have to go back to where you left off. 0r you can just try to exit right away and then restart it. It‚Äôs VERY annoying. None of my other streaming apps do this. You need to do a better job Peacock or charge less for your sub-par app."
Leon De La Rosa,Keeps crashing and ends up crashing my tablet system as well to the point the not even quick restart works
Carter Coy,i love it
Eve Wood,The app is inconsistent. It stops to load so so frequently it makes it extremely frustrating to watch anything. It sounds like many other users experience the same thing. It's time they invest in the product they are selling or make it free since it doesn't work half the time.
Jasmine Scott,nice
E,I pay EXTRA to watch what I choose COMERCIAL FREE yet I still have to sit through peacock commercials!? Not cool.
Devin Brown,loving it loving the Chucky show that doll a dang mess! and unlimited SNL YASSSSSSS Lorne Michaels all day every day!!!!
MojoGojo CasaDomain,"It has good content, but my main complaint is there's no way to delete your ""continue watching"" shows or movies. You essentially have to just fast forward to the end. Which is tedious in time-consuming. Would be cool if you could just include a ""remove this from my continue watching"" option Like most other streaming services have"
Heidi Jarred,always a blast to watch my WWE programing here
Latricia Triche,"Went up on the price but the app got worse, freezing every 3 minutes great shows but how can I enjoy them if they are freezing this is my last month."
Scott Dady,"I had it at 5* before but now the app just doesn't work anymore. It's up to date, but now it won't let me go in to watch anything except on my TV. I want to watch something from my phone and I can't. What gives?"
Scott Trumpie,Terrible user interface. No free trial.
Hernandez 89,love peacock best app
Abi Neylon,gewwq
Luke Bama,great app
DaShelle E Cranker,Lost ability to watch ANYTHING ON/THROUGH PEACOCK
Matthew McCorkle,i love peacock
Barbie L,"I purchased + through their website. I've had none of the issues described below (crashing etc.) The content is good and has gotten better and better with time. (I had been using Peacock for more than 4 years before upgrading) Dear Peacock: Don't ever let go of the person who structures ad placement. This is a feature unique to only you guys and whomever presented this originally, understands what customers REALLY want. You guys are the BEST streaming service."
shanane Whyte,Horrible!
David GRAY,CANCELLED/UNINSTALLED. Lack of interesting content/no family friendly content.
Jeff Barker,Awful
Jason Klimcheck,"glitchy app, some pretty offensive commercials. very glad I only did 1 month membership"
Switchkill118,I love peacock TV but unfortunately I have not been able to watch anything because once I hit something to watch it plays for five seconds then goes to peacock home screen.
James Berlin,terrible when it comes to watching on data. Just sits there and tells me I don't have internet even though every other app works. I wish WWE would work with Amazon or something.
Jennifer Spaulding,What would make this app better is if you had a means to turn off the autoplay when you finish a show and it starts another show that I don't want to watch. Or to be able to clear off your watch list. What also would make it better is to tell you what not to suggest to me.
Rachel Jackson,"Great shows but why does the continue watching option keep disappearing??? Very annoying, and also the mobile app is not giving option to add to My Stuff (my stuff showing empty?)"
Cynthia Baumgardner,"It will not load on my phone app, even though i tried several times. I must be doing something wrong."
Matt Moore,Good programming I can't find on other streaming services.
Joe Bobryk,The app does not work properly when continuing a show. It will completely skip the episode you are currently on and move to the next one as if you already watched the previous episode. The only way to fix is to search the show up and click the previous episode
PJ B. Wilson,"Supposed to have a ""FREE"" OPTION, BUT IT DOESN'T!! Why?!? NO STARS!!"
Tiffanie Green,I love this app but sometimes it doesn't load properly üòï and keeps buffering
Brandon Dunn,Worst platform I've ever purchased. Can never watch anything on any given day without it buffering every 5 mins. wish I could get a full refund for the length of my subscription.
Matt Hurley,Worst of the streaming services... Expensive for the content available. Ads at most subscription levels that are intolerable. UI is weak at best. Significant limitations on app capabilities unless you pay for the top tier which defeats the benefit of cutting chord to stream. Add to it NBCUniversal's stinginess with licensing to others the few good shows/movies it has makes it even more frustrating.
christopher noelk,too many commercials
Jorge Justiniano,Live stream keeps crashing
Dominic,Great options!
Jesse Nichols,love my wwe!ü•∞üòç
Zach Riley,"Super cool that after giving them my money their app will not work, telling me to check my internet and try again, regardless of my internet connection. Quality work guys, pirating is easier than this üëèüèª"
Carey Wiley,Very choppy app it crashes alot
Veronica B,"Peacock is quickly becoming my new favorite streaming app. Lisa Frankenstein, New Girl, now Community, plus all the documentaries and true crimes, Ripper Street, Suits, Monk and Psych, I could go on and on. Peacock makes me happy ü§ó"
Markell Smith,good üëç üëç
Jess Panopio,"Good content overall. HOWEVER, the app itself has issues with login. I am able to login on the desktop/website but this app keeps saying my credentials are incorrect. Annoying."
Catherine welliver,Efficient and easy to do
Philip Meagher,Live video constantly fails to load on my pixel. Despite any troubleshooting steps attempted.
Routh Guffey,Cool app.
Rickey Adams,I love this app
Shira Banyan,I really like this app it good üëçüèø
Cristopher Gonz√°lez Arroyo,Money thieves. I pay 3 times the 6.68 suscripci√≥n and they cancel my suscripci√≥n and stay with my money

Justin M,wwe rocks
Theodovia Green,what is going on with my peacock account
Bella Thornton,I like it so far
Mark Pellegrino,Ordered three days ago and it says it doesn't recognize my email or password. Total BS can't wait to cancel it thanks for nothing. No person to talk to either

Derek Rico,Good for watching WWE
Reeda Davis,poor connection
Theresa Gaines,Great app!!
Bobbi Skaggs,Awesome
G4gasR gaming,"Love this app, just a bit slow sometimes, but it is a great app"

Austin K. Anaglate,Great
Adam James,"difficult to navigate and find WWE network content. I would pay $20, for just the WWE network. I wish I didn't have to see all the non WWE content. This app doesn't work well with my weak rural Internet connection."
Casero Music,"This app kaga so much on every device, Chromecast, the phone, the tv.... Every other streaming app works so I know it's the app ."
Gail Rutkowski,I have to continue using my device in order to watch on my tv. Now I can't even stream from my mobile to my TV. Ugggg! So the payment was updated. But I still can't open the shows o want to watch still saying subscribe to watch. But I all ready subscribe
Susan Frederick,I like this app I can't get it work on my TV and my Xbox what do I have to do please let me know
Brian Sweet,It's April 2024 and this still doesn't support 60FPS playback on Android...
Kaitlin Nunnery,"Continue watching doesn't work. When I click on an episode or movie in a series, it just plays the next one instead of playing where I left off. Also, there is not an episode list accessible while watching a show or from the continue watching list. I have to search for the show and then find the episode."
Jorge Razo,"Most unnerving sports streaming service, unlike ANY other app, you don't get all the games through the app. You need to pay for the app plus find another service for their live tv channels to follow all the matches. This is the only service I have found that does this!"
Marie W.,"Horrible cell phone app! Was working fine for a few weeks. Now does not load. All other cell phone T.V. apps are working great. Performed all of the suggested fixes per customer service techs to resolve. Hours later the phone app started working, only to be dissapointed with the same app issues again the next day! I'm now e-mailing Peacock for suggestions about how to resolve this broken app again! C'mon Peacock, your competition has this mobile app game won already. Please fix this!!!"
Andrea Hinojos,I Love it the movie Lisa Frankenstein.
Reta Berry,Not used it much yet. Spectrum is my paid TV source.
Lauren Walter,Awesome
Chris I,can't continue watching something when I pause and come back. on my TV app it buffers non stop to the point I give up. peacock up your game I pay money to you
brooke,Best app to watch whatever you like or whatever your in the mood for!!! THE BEST!!!
The Schracken,love wwe
Codeman Kramer,love some of their movie releases
John Gardenhire,WWE PPVs should be immediately available after the event is over. WWE is the ONLY reason why I pay for Peacock. Why do I have to wait several hours to see what I missed?
Aaron Bougher,BEST OF THE BEST 2024
Quintin Guillot,The app doesn't even work. Missed Wrestlemania over it. Will be unsubbing. What a scam.
Nelson Kuan,"Chromecasting is such a frustrating experience with this app. If I click to watch a show that I'm already watching, the app decides to skip the episode and start a new episode instead. There's no way to select a different episode without closing Chromecast and search normally. Also, of all the media apps on my phone, this app doesn't respond to controls from any of my headphones (it's like the app is invisible and other media apps trigger)."
Bearded Curt,Doesn't work
anthony speaker,need more wwe
Claudia Magilke,I love peacock and some of their original movies are fantastic and the fact that I've been without internet for a few days and I'm able to go ahead and watch ny samsung note phone is so cool

C.B. Martin,Your commercials are way too inappropriate

Jonathan Ahern,Great app for watching WWE!!
Kyle R. Benoit,Lobe this APP
Tamiko Tomlinson,"They don't have a lot of good , update movies. The TV series are great"
Purrtylil Kbear,Seriously. Too many dumb commercials plus the annoying ads in the middle of users watching a movie is really annoying and it's a real waste of time and money. Ridiculous idea and ridiculous people.
Sky Hall,you have an account you pay for the premium and you still can't sign in.
Teddy Nyaketcho,It doesn't work in my country
Kristin,"signed in and immediately was unable to stream anything to my TV. When I tried to watch it on my phone, the video quality was so incredibly bad."
Simon Hunt,NBC has playback issues on their sports broadcasts. It's always double playing a string of commercials.
ike Makanani,best app
A. J.,The worst app I saw it.
·ã®·äõ·å•·â†·â• EthioFidel,Even I wish ü§û to give 0 star
Perry Carpiaux,"So far,so good"
Chris D.,It keeps freezing and dropping .
Barry Tullous,I love peacock
Russell,Excellent Video Watching!
Annabella Nesbitt,I love it. Home of The Office. Might bump rating down since you canceled Quantum Leap
Paticia Scharbarth,great!
Heather Etchison,App is slow to load and navigate.
Chase Jones,things don't stream properly
Dale roy Whit,U know PPL sleeping different good ways too see lste shows and catch up on news
Jeffrey Bower,"excellent streaming app, but tooo many commercials!"
duane spencer,Watch 3 minutes of ads and then get an error so you have to watch 3 more minutes before you ever start the show. Pretty garbage.
Russell Price,"Original TV shows and a huge library of on demand shows and many movies you won't find anywhere else. If they showed fewer commercials, I would give it 5 stars. Although 2 minutes of commercials before a movie, then an uninterrupted movie is great."
creechcameron1130gmail,first time I like it but to be honest I'm here for wrestle mania 40
TT C,"Works really good. Could use some more new movies, not much to watch ATM waiting for some series to have a new season."
David None,poor
Byron Loftis,Way too many ads
Thomas Place,Please give me more than a few seconds to watch the credits of the show I just finished before starting the next episode or suggested program. 100% annoying and I usually find myself exiting out of the app completely.
Jacqueline Barsodi,difficult to maneuver in this ap
Robby Mata,This app is taking too much room
Cyril Griffin,"trying to cancel subscription, no luck?"
Shawn Palmer,They have movies and shows to watch.
Gabriel,I cannot subscribe. It gets cancelled everytime.
James Chase,Maybe thr bugs should be worked out before the next price increase? Can't watch a show because it says it needs an active internet connection...which is working fine...or it just sits and loads
Telepathy,The Statue of Liberty
Andy B.,some great stuff
Jose Carrillo,"initially only wanted the app to rewatch The Office, but the variety of shows and movies has gotten excellent. Not to mention the premier League and also most of Team USA's games."
Trepis Fenris,Ruined by Ads
Too Raps,Worked well
Men Arnold,Can't add team or league to My Stuff. No Bluetooth control. No background play. No mobile data saver (other than disabling mobile playback). Inconsistent audio quality in Premier League games. Suspect picture quality on phone and PC.
Misty,"Can't get anything to play on this app.. it keeps saying ""unknown error has occurred "" all of my other streaming apps work fine, so it's not my reception or any connection issues.. I've been having problems for a month.. I love the selection but too bad I can't watch any of them!!"
Ryleigh Bodley,i love this app I think it's a little glitchy buy very good!
marti beeson,It's ok. Somewhat decent selection. You have to watch ads even though you pay for the service.
Beverly Fleischer,"I have not been able to get on Peacock all day. When I do watch it the show is ok at the beginning but then it starts jumping on the screen. It is making me very upset. Also I can watch all the previews of the programs but, it will not let me watch my continue watching shows."
josh root,"Great programming and great pricing. probably my favorite of all the streaming services. Also, THE OFFICE!!!"
Sabrina Lamas,"Loving this app so far. No troubles streaming, and there's a variety of shows and movies."
Michael Thorn,I like rainbows
Michael Charles,Great service but if you opt for the plan with commercials if you skip past commercial points after just watching adds it'll still force you to watch all the additional adds up to that point back to back before playing again. I get making you watch at least one set but not all of them
Kay Kay (Wutwut007),"Much better than it was, appreciate the minimized video so I can check emails and texts without exiting out of the app completely each time, still a little buggy when scrolling but otherwise the update is great"
Anthony doc,I'm enjoying it
Alesha,Impossible to upgrade your plan!
Collin Berquist,"The app looks good but functions poorly. If you lock your screen (or pause a show and your phone times out) when you ulock the screen the show will start over from the beginning. The items on your ""continue watching"" don't take you to the episode list or give you any options, it just starts playing the show. Pretty clunky design."
Lynn S,"Shady billing. When I originally signed up, I was charged the Premium Plus price when I only wanted the Premium subscription. Thought I clicked something wrong, and let it go. Turns out, not my error at all. In trying to sign up again, I repeatedly click to subscribe to Premium; however, when I go to pay, an additional fee for the Plus version keeps populating. There is no option to correct. It also shows subsequent billing months at the increased rate. Guess you just lost my business for good."
Kevin Uchiha,"great service, they got all the new stuff and the best content"
Ebonie G,yuh aye pop it pop it pop it uh yuh aye right foot uh left foot uh also it gets really glitchy sometimes ^_^ (I'm on my laptop)
niterunr miller,love it I'm able to watch my favorite shows that are on while I'm at work once I get home I can open peacock search for myself and enjoy it before bedtime
Pamela Carter,awesome
Amanda,love it
Niki,junk
Susan Sostack,love the options
Mary Edmonds,This app sucks. That's all there is to it.
Joseph Lubeck,"Love Peacock, has a lot of great content on it. I Love the Chucky Series."
Jack B,Get constant error messages that I'm not on a network. Only can stream via my TV connected Xfinity gateway and never works on my phone or tablet. Another Comcast ripoff!
Heather Wilmoth (MissOperaGhost),Would give it 5 if it stops playing adds when I pay for add free $6 a month!
Alex Nield,"I just wish you could stop auto play. I don't use this app at night to watch my favorite shows because it won't stop and I lose all my data if I fall asleep. I guess I'll just watch it on Hulu. Reply, I am on a wifi plan with limits. I don't use the app at night to fall asleep to because it uses too much data. So I choose to use other apps that doesn't have automatic auto play. I mainly use the app for premier League soccer. But my favorite shows have generally been NBC produced."
Rebecca Orozco,I love peacock movies and WWE
Christina Miller,"I have so many issues with this app. The video is choppy, it's freezes way too much and the app just crashes way too much. Please fix."
Tremont Murphy,I only been watching for a few weeks and I love it.
Minta Sanchez,"Every time I try to use picture in picture on my phone, the app starts to glitch and eventually freezes my phone. I've cleared the cache, cleared the data, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, checked to make sure it had the necessary permissions, and nothing fixes it. I'm ready to cancel the subscription üôÑ"
jane harless,Every time I turn on the app it goes to last season Then I have to go back to the start and change to season 59. It would be better if it would go to the right day to start. I got the app just to watch Days of Our Lives.
Gwendalin Hartsock,Would be way better if the movies and shows had subtitles. Would rate 5 stars. But every single movie I watch doesn't even offer subtitles. You have a button for it but none of the movies have subtitles for them. Also it always restarts the movie if you have to pause it. Then when you try to go fast forward back to where you were it freezes and does nothing every time.
Fidoro Scalercio,"slow to open programs, playback error messages all the time, app crashing, connectivity problems."
Onix Rodriguez,AWESOME
Charles E MrDerp541,"Only downloaded to watch the Dan Patrick show. It always lags with the audio. Mouths move before the sound does. Or you get a buffering circle, and it stops over and over. Dan has been with NBC for a while now even before they created peacock. It's always been weak as F."
Diana Bedard,has so much entertainment
Kim Hopper,"I love Peacock. the ""for you"" algorithm could be better but the uncensored Bravo content, movies, etc make it worth it."
Denise Kinzalow,this is the best app
Gregory Todd,"Movies and kids' stuff generally have all the ads up front, so that's nice. The only things I can really complain about are that you can't dislike anything, so they'll quit suggesting it, and when switching between TV and the app, the app usually restarts your episode. For the price and content, this is a great app. I do like how the 10 secs forward and back buttons are large and center screen when you want to use them."
Green Conure,Only paid version. No more free service and one paid version still has ads. No thanks!
Maximus1318,"The 2 stars is for the mobile app. It is the worst. Constantly freezes and then have to wait anywhere from 8 to 20 seconds to be able to click a movie. Not to mention missing basic functions like separating your list alphabetically. Could/should be 10√ó better. Not to mention it gives a limit on what you can save so everytime I save, something gets knocked off the list."
Jeffrey Waller,"New review since my last review, not changing my rating. Since my WiFi expense is going to go up soon, I gotta decide on things to cut to make up the difference. If Peacock is going to continually buffer and not play anything as it is doing now, can't keep it. I do love the option to watch any SNL I want at any time. Just fix the app please."
Kylah Limbaugh,"Normally love this app and had no issues. Not until the last few weeks of using it. I HATE the feature that when you push down on any part of the screen it automatically fast forwards or rewinds your show (depending on what part of the screen you're touching). Also, my app is constantly telling me on my home page that I have no internet connection! Then allows me to search and watch just fine. App is fully updated and all. Not sure what the issue is."
MO‡≤†_‡≤†,where is the promo code located in The app
laurenfaye heryford,love the programs
Aaron St. Croix,bare minimum
Heather Kinsfather,has the best of everything
Shift,App won't open
Dave Williams,"Good content and the app works well. However, as a paying subscriber, I find it ridiculous that it asks you ""are you still there?"" while you try to binge watch anything. while casting to a large screen, you must answer this incredibly annoying question far too often. This ruins the entire experience. I will not be renewing my paid subscription."
Kevin Pierce,The positive is they the run the voice. Big negative is movie choice. still have same of the same movies from 3 or 4 years ago! Edit I only use peacock cuz they have the voice which i have to have premium and i have almost thrown my phone at the wall because of tremendous lag. My phone is good and i clear my cache three times per day. Once my monthly subscription runs out i will not resubscribe and most likely i will uninstall. Like some1 else said you're a billion dollar company. Get it 2gether
Tanya Kasper,"I cancelled back in January 2024. I keep getting billed every month. Every time I try to log in to try and cancel again, it read that I am not subscribed!!! Super frustrating!!! STOP BILLING ME"
Robert Pedrin,Nothing free about it üëéüëé
Maria Randall,it's load to much during shows
John LaRocque,Love Jackson Browne's Music
Patrick Vossen,Always enjoy the selection and Premier League coverage.
Erica Potter,"ok. not a great movie selection. Also, no way to erase watch history so that's annoying."
Ryan Pierce,"Ad tiers are a joke at this point. Got this subscription free with the awful Xfinity ISP that came with my apartment. Then after a few months, they decided I wasn't paying them enough for Internet and gave me a ""deal"" on Peacock. I watch European soccer and can't afford a TV subscription so I endulged their $2.99/m for 1 year. I can NEVER WATCH MY TEAM PLAY! They are top three in their league yet SOMEHOW they aren't the fan favorites? Screw off NBC, Peacock, and Universal. ARRRGGG."
Monika,Coz youre greedy and got into subscription for what was free already
DORT Fault,SI IE WONDER IN SPACE DON'T TEAR UP STR8 FEARLESS BRITZ JETS ART IN CRAFT MOBILE WIRELESS CURRENCY BUCKS MARS V√è√ç√é√åƒ™
David Upton,"I don't understand when you subscribe to peacock. You can't get it on your phone. You can get on your t. V or your iPad, but they want you to pick a plan Pay for and be able to watch It on several devices. You may have you shouldn't be charged for each device. device. You should be able to subscribe to it and Add it to your own personal devices. !!"
Lisa Carr,I just want to upgrade to the higher commercial free plan and I can not figure out how.
Breanna Taylor,Really good exsep not sure updated shows for this month I wanted a weekly or monthly news letter sent to my Gmail but haven't got eather since beginning of last month still hoping they sent a news letter on shows and showtime for watch soon because I want to know what I can watch well I have peacock
Fay Hofmann,does peacock no longer have a free option
Brian Keating,Love it!
j valentine,Anytime I try to exit the app it freezes on the screen and I'm forced to restart my phone. Fix the app
David Lebron,I like the app
Jenn Bryant,Lovely
Takuma,I wish ALL of the Premier League matches were live. The replays aren't good enough.
Corey Maloy,Excellent app
April Clark,Everytime I go to watch all it shows is a black screen done good first 2 days and now nothing at all I wanna be reimbursed if I can't watch it I'm not just giving money away even if it is 6$ yall need to do something about this ASAP
Toni Carroll,"Here are some of my recommendations to watch Heros, Chesapeake Shores, Way Home and Merlin. Three of these have a lot of hidden messages that resignate with me on so many levels. See if they do you especially if you haven't started to awaken"
MJ Kucij,Easy to use. But sometimes NEVER CASTS.
Nancy,So much programming. This app is easy to use. I love it.
Michelle branch,I recommend you do not use this on your phone because it has streaming issues and customer service isn't even a real person üòû
J D,I just recently subscribed to peacock. The ad version has a good amount of advertismemt however it varies depending . I think tv shows have the most yet some movies and peacock original have les or none it just depends on the content your watching. I mainly got it because of SNL The app its self works well it could be more fluid with shortcut options imo especially when trying to look from A-Z movie list. Several movies arrive and leave monthly some stay longer to watch .
Kendra Smith,"App is ok. But beware of Peacock. They double charge when they want to and you don't get it back. There is no way to contact them except through email then they say sorry we can't help you! Was a customer , not anymore! Good luck. Switching to a different streaming app."
Carter K,Constantly crashing. Trash.
crystal kayounga,Great for on the go!
Aaryn Bergum,Won't launch - just keeps telling me to check my internet. Why am I paying for something I can't access?
Bill Barker,"Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Always a crapshoot."
BlackCell,"By far the buggiest streaming app ive ever used. Video constantly pauses and reavers even on a blazing fast internet connection when no other streaming service ever buffers. Heaven forbid you do picture-in-picture, it will crash your entire phone. App coding needs a lot of work, I've tried betas that are more functional than this one."
Matt M,could have newer movies
Juno1317,"Terrible streaming service. Crashes constantly, freezes a lot, studders if you try to pause and resume. Will play ads and tell you your show/movie will be ad free, crash then when you try to resume will reply ads and studders. The only reason I have this lame excuse of and app is for the WWE network and can't wait for it to leave."
Sally L,I've been very happy with Peacock.I don't mind their adds because they keep them to a bare minimum imo & short! Peacock pls don't read this and up the adds! I rarely ever give 5 stars as theirs always room for improvement..I like their content as well.
Vicky Delventhal,I have a code for discount for a one year at $30. The app didn't let me enter.
Veronica Espinoza,so many buffering issues
Wilfredo Ramos,Great app for WWE Wrestling. Love this app.
Laurieanne McClure,This sham company took months of payments from my account and I cannot access the site. It says I have to subscribe when I try it says I already have an account but if I have an account why can't I watch the service? You have cheated me out of $23.98 For 2 months of streaming that I have not been able to stream. And when I tried to call to straighten it out there is no phone customer service. This service is a liar and a sham and I want my money back!!!!!!
Anthony Hill,good üëç
Joleane ‚ÄúJojo‚Äù Baker,Fast and easy.
Andrew Hicks,Peacock has classic shows and great movies.
LC,"I dislike the loads of commercials when watching shows. Sure they are only a minute, but they come on incessantly. May as well have cable. I cut cable because of the ads. I thought the streaming service would not have ads since there was not a tier system in their pricing. I'm very disappointed. Shows are sub par at best so I don't think it's worth keeping the service. I do not recommend it."
Rita Hatch,"I canceled my subscription to Peacock several months ago but I'm still being charged each month. I've sent emails, called a ""customer service"" number that has been disconnected and I've even downloaded the app to make sure the subscription was canceled (it was). Not sure what their problem is but I'm notifying the Kansas State Attorney General's office to report this illegal activity. I have no idea why Peacock thinks they have the right to charge people's bank accounts without authorization"
Meredith Bermea,interface is slow and glitchy. no way to disable auto play.
Jared Smith,"Not free, no free option. Lies."
Stacy West,Freezes my phone
Kimberly Gromack,fun fun fun
brandon church,"its pretty good, mainly got it for Brooklyn 99"
Sean Fodor,episodes staring over happens way to often or the app loses it place in an episode after a comercial
Lonnie Ingram,GREAT PRICE AND OPTIONS FOR YOUR MONEY
None of your BUSINESS,"I Hate NY NBC peacock support it sucks!!!! Peacock TV streaming not Worth getting.and I hate co the steel and sell your data shame on you. Peacock save your money and get Netflix, Hulu, Paramount and others"
Casa Nova,Anything with commercials should be free You make money from the commercials there's no reason to pay for this app You can't even watch the Olympics on here when they have Why would I ever want to watch this app Oh that's right I wouldn't
Betty Neave-Aguero,What happened to the feature so we can watch from the app to the big screen please fix it and bring back the free plan
Jump Start,With everyone having issues why would I useit
Damon LaFargo,HATE THIS Fing thing. Good luck canceling this POS.
Jennifer Nelson,"I get that they have to have ads unless you buy the add free version, even then there are some ads. But the basic version has a commercial break every 5 minutes. It's a bit excessive. I only watch 2 two shows Resident Alien & Top Chef. I'm not paying $13 for 2 shows to be ad free."
Nicole Mills,love it
Cieara Gause,I love peacock has just what I love to watch.
Jeff Hall,"I paid for ad-free, now get ads. I will be canceling."
Matt Dunkin,Peacock lags & skip after about 15 minutes into a program. Other streaming apps don't have this problem.
Nelson,Won't let me sign in . Says it doesn't recognize e mail and password while showing them.
Jen Moss,not user friendly.
Michelle Murphy,The app consistently buffers and stops. The support says it's internet etc but we have high speed due to wfh and the way peacock streams shows. It doesn't appear to get better with the troubleshooting options provided. Disappointed in the performance
Osorno Miskut Coleman,very good
Dawn Ramirez,an exceptional show!!
Enchanting 1908,Will not allow me to login
Travis Tracy,All of the content keeps buffering even with 1gb internet speeds
Camden Chose,None of the shows load. My internet is fine and all other streaming services work.
V1rus696,"Absolute garbage app. You pay for a subscription, and it only plays ads and not movies. Tried watching the new trolls with my kids, and it would show their ad and then stop playing. So I would select it again, and then it would show the same ad and stop playing."
Josh Murillo,having trouble casting to Chromecast
R. Keenum,No longer my fav. Freezes everytime I open. Have tried everything.
S S,Does not work on the phone right and can't get it to work
Nicole Manning,buffers to much

Jo x,"no way to remove items that automatically play, not user friendly."
Claristia Benson,I want my money back please

Kenny Darby,good üòä
Brett Atkins,Lots of Ads
ighojevwe agbatutu,Nice
Mike Raskin,not good
Fatimah Broxton,I love the Croods Family Tree show
Alva Smith,I mostly use it to watch sports. Works good! I want to cancel but can't. Don't use this app!
J Quin (JQuin),"Update: it's been a couple years and I still can't remove things from Continue Watching.. why?? Then there's the PL. As the PL Hub, it should carry all matches. Replays are always ridiculously late. States it would be available at 6, it's now 1330 and still not available. Aside from that, it's a decent app with some good content, not worth paying for though. Multi-billion dollar company and they can't have things on time or stream smoothly, that's poor service."
J Garza Jr,perfect variety for the entire family whether separately or as a family watching film or shows
Desudro Ycpanno,App sucks search feature sucks. It is hard to find replays of sport events you want to watch.
Randy Oquendo,awesome
James Triana,Good great
Nicholas Boyle,crashes a lot
Andrew Jones,"great movies and series, and it's not too expensive!!"
Jonathan Winston,"Different than Netflix, but I can handle it."
Nancy Palus,"I have not run into slow or spotty playback, unless I am not near Wi-Fi ."
Scott Findl,Won't log in. Said there was a problem and call customer service. What a joke
Marc Morales,Needs live MSNBC. Otherwise it works fine. It does let you stream you local NBC affiliate live so that's a plus.
Jill Harris-Castro,cant upgrade to no add version
Kris Rao,continually freezes
Niko Saladino,Best streaming app out there.
Sheenah Camp,too many commercials but I like it and it's cheap üòÅ
Brandon Gilmore,does not support HDR on new Bravia TVs
Patrick Long,"When Peacock began they hyped premier league soccer, they show several games each month but its half hearted. Newcastle fan here, they played today then again Tuesday, neither on Peacock. They don't respond to reviews so am stuck. USA shows games but need more $ for this. Peacock is overall a joke"
David Yackell,Live broadcast commentary is glitching. Sounds like someone stuttering that got struck by lightning.
John Ramos,hello. my name is John ramos... our similarities begin and end with this one app... peacock is a good app-doodad. you can take that as a john ramos guarantee... do not approach me on the streets and try to initiate conversation... that is all
Vicki S,app stopped working on Verizon steam TV. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn't load past the logo screen.
Marcos Ayala,excellent
Miguel Diaz,"it would have been a great app, but it kept signing me out, and the rewind/FF feature when I hold my phone kept fast forwading my show unintentionally which was super frustrating."
Romella Maldonado,best shows &best platform!
Jeffrey Preston Jr,This is the best thing to happen since I work overnights so I can keep up to date with my shows
Moo moo Boss hogg,love it
Aaron Groves,love the movie options same with series
Keren Montes de Oca,"Peacock used to be good. NOT ANY MORE!! it glitches, buffers and freezes too much. It has great original shows but the amount of problems this streaming app is not worth the pay. üòî"
Lila Vigil,movie cuts off before its done!
Mario Sanders,"I remember when peacock first started it was great!! NOT ANY MORE. . It glitches pausing and playing, when rewinding and fast forwarding, when returning to the video and it bufferS while still playing the audio with no image. With so many glitches I won't be resubscribing. You have great shows but the amount of glitches is ridiculous üòî sorry"
John Bruce,mid
Pamela Stroman-Howerton,Wonderful selection and easy to manuever!
Lynn E,Don't know what's going on but only certain TV programs will play tonight...ugh
Jason Centrone,jax looks unrecognizable in the valley!
miki b,Used to be able to pay my subscription with Google opinion rewards but now I can't. Costumer service rep said that is not option anymore. Told 3 times my card has no money on it and he just kept sending link to pay with the card or PayPal.
Linda Potters,"I love Peacock. They have great originals, movies, and reality shows. I really can't wait for the next season of Poker Face and so many others. Peacock is a one stop channel for me."
VexedPidgeon,stability improvement required
David Liautaud,Lies not free
Anfreenee Germain,Why is it that y'all have a whole wwe section but Hulu is more up to date on weekly episodes of raw and smackdown. While the latest episode you have are a whole month old. That's why I gave a 2/5 cuz I find that stupid and a waste of my money. I only subbed for all thing WWE... Not old things WWE
Sarah Salter,like how many shows here. something for my whole family.
Elissa Baker,not working..no way to contact
J Dub,"Constantly drops shows, logs you out, and repeats adds over after dropping out. Not worth the money."
Becky Eaton,Love this app! It works just as well on my phone as on my tv.
Sasha Selvin,Streaming for all.
Nathaniel Westbrook,glitching and sudden app failure.
KRISTI Skelton,The app will no longer cast to any Google hubs. NBC corporate greed knows no bounds. We pay for the service we should be able to watch it on any devices.
Leslie Bailey,I wish they carried more complete news shows from MSNBC like a complete broadcast of Rachel Maddow.
Connie Kennedy,Love this site
Howard Poole,great shows
Eryn Greer,Hardly use the app because options are weak compared to other streaming apps but the main issue I have when I do find something is that it glitches so bad the movie you are watching crashes then when you stop casting to get back to the movie it restarted the entire movie. I've also had problems where I click on a movie and it chooses a different instead.
Diego Nicholas,An Insane Amount Of Ads! Do Not Subscribe!
AvengerHulk23,various options to choose from!
Donald Amagrande,Awesome Thanks
Boob Punch,it's got good shows and stuff
W XY,Peacock TV have very good programs to watch
Holly Jackman,hardly works
Bruce Sowles,I'd like a ad version that's free to use..
jorge moreno,hate the ads
Jack Bloomer,Why do I pay for it and still get ads I might as well get cable
Roberto Suarez,Fun to watch
John Hanson,love peacock and love the prices inexpensive and affordable movies Hallmark and drama and wrestling and Olympics can't wait
Art Sedmont,"Hanks at his usual best with a prescient message about the power of a story and it's ability to change the course of history. Watch this young actress, she is a wunderkind in the making."
Angela Danes,not happy about this!!!
Pancha Guzman,Why don't you update your app it skips and it's mess up and we pay for this app fixs the issue idiot's
Andy Jay,It's extremely frustrating. Why do I always have to search for the shows I've been watching to continue? They should come right up. Also - the adds are annoying.
Nichole Currell,Peacock is the place to watch everything
Damian Samarakone,Absolutely awesome. The best ever movies for free online. Limitless choice of movies; day or night!
Joy Ghosh,Nice collection but there are certain Horror or action movies which u cant find only on certain sites but they take ages to load. But happy with site and pleanty of options and stuff to watch and loads quickly :-)
Kevin,great use all the time
Cameron,i like lesbian films yet there don't seem to be any . I think though it's quite a good place to be
Jenifa Kim,It works for the most part however theres to many adds and I wish there was less so everyone can enjoy watching their show without getting interupted without having to watch like 3 adds in a row. One time i had to watch 7 ads in a row which is ridiculous.
William Sheridan,does what I need it to do. could use some improvements. but I can wait.
David Landes,Was a 5 now a 0. Chromecast is junk since the update. Kill my pcs network connection and requires a restart to fix it.
William Thomas,Awesome app! although sometimes the subtitles are glitchy or some other minor problems. (would rate 4 1/2 but the stars it wouldn't let me.)
edson machu,Hello my friend
Quentin,"I work a lot, so this is a good app.It keeps me update even when i'm at work"
john folz,you could find what you want to watch
Mark Downs,I like it but it takes 3 to 4 hours to watch a movie because the adds buffer the movie will normally go through with out buffering but the adds have taken an hour or more if they could fix that it would be nice Tubi usually has no problem the movie goes like supposed to and the adds don't take hours I hope y'all can fix that because I want to watch stuff but alot of times I don't because I would like to watch it in one day please get the adds where the will play instead of just buffering
Robin,"Recent update has broken external SRT subtitles for me, on both smartphone and Chromecast."
Handri Steyn,This is such an awesome app!!! I am extremely impressed! It does what it says it does! I love it!
terry woodord,all I want is what app do I go to to watch movies
Cristobal Sepulveda,Having to pay 5 bucks to get full video play back is atrocious. Just use plex on chrome. And not only that after paying you dont even get to watch your media because the app doesnt even connect half the time and sais there is no media or its offline when it isnt. Dont use the app.
Kavin Lenjau,Bad
Tshedza Tshitimbi,fun
Stephen Muteswa,üíØ Good I give it 4 stars coz too many ads please try to limit ads but I love it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è it's good
gargi khaire,It's a really Great Great platform to watch masterpieces in cinemas.
Lisa Holliday,LOVE IT!!!
Jose Adrian Vazquez Lee,üëå Superv
HRD Heather 77,Theres a t.v show on Plex that has 3 season called Colony but there is no way to watch it . Why have a show on your app if theres abosolutely no way to watch it. This is fkn ridiculous! üò°üò° Unless this is fixed I will unsub from your streaming app. Sadly netflix doesnt have it either
Gavin Running Horse,a ok
Blanca Morales,I Love Plex!
Dane Sanford,Please fix the bugs in this app (on nvidia shield) BEFORE adding new shiny features! -watchlist incorrectly filters movies and TV shows when trying to only view media that IS available -frequenly crashes when fast forwarding or rewinding (alot) through a movie or TV episode! -NO intention on EVER adding 0.5 or 2x playback speed (available in vlc for YEARS)...the list goes on!
Andrea Fabre Reyes,best movie app
Chris Hesse,Background battery usage is killing my battery.
sylvie vottero,"I love this plex tv app very very much and It is fun and it has the greatest channels and the greatest comedy channels and the greatest game shows channels l ever watched that I would like for you to put in the 100,000 pyramid classic channel with dick Clark please and thank you,"
Darksky297,work great love it
Macy,"It seems really shady, but Plex actually works well. After a hard day of college, I love just vegging out and watching movies on this app. Totally free, very few ads and a LOT of movies. Unlike Netflix, its free, and unlike Tubi, there are actually GOOD movies."

Abdullahi Ibrahim,Good
Paulette Dunlap,Love the variety of great shows and movies.
LeeAnn Bailey,love this movie site!!
Ryan Andersen,"I love Plex. I bought the lifetime pass a long time ago and have been using it on many devices for years. This app however, is too awful to continue using. While I have had very few problems worth caring about on any other device, the android mobile version is so full of bugs. Most of the issues revolve around getting content to play. Browsing is usually ok but when I try to play a movie it will crash, turn black, hang forever, disconnect when I cast to a TV. I hope the fix this app."
Travis Markel,"The ads make the app stop on the fire sticks. Then when I go back into the show, I have to restart the episode or movie. On my tablet the ads freeze up a lot. For a 60 second add it takes 2 or more minutes to get through, do to the freezing up. Other than than the ad issue the app works great. I have done all the updates for all of the devices."
Karen Davey,good app to use I have no problem using it so far thanks.
Timothy Olurotimi,I can't download movies
Terry Torres,pretty great. the ui can be weird or unresponsive when dealing with Bluetooth.
Anima Lector,This app it is like a browser to search movie. üòÖ Use it if you don't trust the Google or other search engine...
John Eats,Casting can be a bit finicky but overall great app
Asghar Abbas,App design has very poor error reporting. Not worth 6 dollars to stream imo. Could be cheaper.
Rjchard,Lots of free movies. Lots to watch on this app. Fr tho. Real talk talk.
Rogelio Pastrana Jr.,Great!
bruce banner,Hate speech
Emilio Hernadez,great movies
Leeanne Gamache,Limited sci fi movies
Chad Atkinson,"Only issue I have is that continue watching doesn't appear anywhere on my home page like it does on all other Plex apps that I use. Very strange, but not enough of an inconvenience to be to affect the rating. As always, I'm very happy with Plex"
Moises De Leon,Great app awsome
David Rosicke,"This has been a great tool to have all our movies readily available. Plus, pulling the extras shorts videos from the DVDs and having them properly indexed is fun!"
Asher Flynt,awesome! it just works
Ramchandra Deshmukh,Wow superb perfect

Paula McClintock,really SUPER!!
Riley Bird (Bird),very good
Hank Knoell,Plex is awesome. The recent improvements have made it even better.
Crystal Frye,This movie üé• app is one that took me back to my childhood when I used to watch Godzilla. the movie looked the same as it did when I watched it back in 1974. this felt great and brought back positive memories. it was not in English but if you read it the words of what the cast said was in English. I didn't mind. I still loved watching the movie as if I was still 9 years old with the same excitement I had for the Godzilla movies back then. thanks.
kellie knowles,I would recommend downloading and there's loads of really good stuff
Donna Gonzalez,I enjoy watching movies with plex
Viktoriya Paskar,Chi
Lovely Toblerone,I think external IPTV needs to improve but Plex itself is mostly great. I need to be able to admin the servers from my phone tho pls!
Matt Taylor,"Never works properly. Have to constant close and restart app. Will not consistently cast to tv. If you aren't careful with how you play something, it won't work. Can't believe this is the best app out there for this. Someone do better please, I'm begging you."
Miriah Dettenhaim,xelP
Andrew Partington,"I run my own Plex server for my family's use and this is still by far the best platform for streaming your own media. The free content is just a bonus for me, I'll happily put up with a few ads."
Lisa Evans,"Plex is great. I actually don't mind the ads either... I'm really enjoying it. In fact, I told my son how good it is üòÉ thanks üòÑ"
Manuel Vichi,"Plex, why? Why I have to pay to stream from my server with my connection on the application? I can do this from the website for free, this app is useless!"
Tebogo Desmond,Great app
Kyle,no regrets paying full price for a lifetime membership. does everything I need it to do and then some!
gokul Aruna,Good morning üåÖ and wild
Diane Rowell,I miss you moma
Benjamin Powell,"It's pretty solid, not sure why I jave to have a subscription but it's support the platform so worth it for updates."
Vernon Thomas,I love it as it as old and new movies
Elite doodoos Lulu,it's a very good movie app and I got some very good movies on here and some very good TV shows
Pierre Grobler,to many advertising during movies
Alfie Koko,very poor support
Eric Alan,everything loads have had nothing but good watching experience since day one of download
David Jefferson,if it were possible to rate this app a -100 I definitely would its the most unusable app I have ever downloaded its totally useless
Lissale,"So many different programs & tv shows, always entertaining... a game changer.. üëç‚ù§"
Mark Wilkinson,Absolutely love it üëç
Steve Merkel,Super glitchy. I had to uninstall.
Luwie Kativhu,This is a great App but i am really disappointed with your ad that show up while i am watching a movie it's really bad how can i watch the ad that is about 1 minutes and 20 seconds please fix this
Tom Kisner,Legendary app.
Garret Watson,Wish it could be fixed by today
Luke Spencer,bloody good
John Dee,Typical app. Not what I wanted.
AL Nolan,The movies/TV shows start. Then stop suddenly?
Rylan ‚ÄúThe Visitor‚Äù Peden,It is absolutely foolish that I have to PAY FOR THE ABILITY TO WATCH MY STUFF when quite literally every other Plex client I have used just lets you do it for free with no arbitrary limitations
K Roshan,Bakwas this is ford only typist Timepass
tim,"WACK,but nice thanks"
Kieran Lynch,Very good
Richard Martin,"I know how hard dev team work,done good.but to glitchy can't sit down and watch."
jun Burlas,awesome
LifeCoach Cher-ie,"newbie, application is awesome so far"
Gregory Wilk,amazing amazing
Garrett Reilly,the app handles everything I need it to.couldn't ask for more maybe just some different theme colors.if you take the time to set it up right you're going to get the perfect app for what you need.
edward lee,Wish I had more time to watch Plex. Great selection.
Jim Goodrich,"Works pretty well, rewind is a little awkward but once you figure out it works well enough. Very ad heavy though. And it loses a star because it won't work on Android without a sign in."
daniel biden,Fix app on PlayStation
Betty Cooper,love just watching one show!
Ryan Samek,"The 4/9 update completely broke the app and it couldn't even open to show the Plex logo before crashing. I had to uninstall it multiple times before it worked again, and now it won't recertify my purchase and let me watch stuff again even though Plex sorry said they did it."
Filip Kaevikj,"This app is true trash, it will ask for email and so many things and you will not watch your movie at the end, thanks bye"
M K,After updating the app I still can't play downloaded media without a connection on airplane mode. Keeps asking for a connection to play content already on my phone. Useless. Friend recommended Jellyfin. Will try that instead of paying for a subscription to Plex.
Robert Critch,Fine job happy
Frank Coyote,No my kin of streaming
Yasso Moh,sometimes movies don't appear and
Murree Mobile,Snnuhy
James Moore,no big titles
Vince Emman,Bro there's no platforms on where I can watch what I want to watch
L. T. H.,"Thank you, it works again. üòÄ"
Jeff,This app is awesome! It's my own personal Netflix that I share with friends and family.
Idowu Tofunmi,I can't watch movies on it So sad üòî
Russell Gentry,awesome sauce
stephen eniye,I love it
VR K,"This app will be fine, in this the Hollywood movie does not come in Hindi dubbed like Amazon, Netflix and other apps come with Hindi dubbing, however if this also had Hollywood movie with Hindi dubbing then it would have been more fun to watch."
john C,easy to use
Zizipho Madingana,enjoying the app so much
Merlinzbeard ‚ÄúMerlinzbeard‚Äù,One of the best media decisions I ever made
July Rain,"What a pity. The movie has no English or Vietnamese subtitles. Uninstall the application immediately. Movie viewing applications with subtitles in at least one language, English, will attract many viewers. Applications to watch movies without subtitles are outdated, technology is going backwardsüëé"
Gregory,love it
William West,OK
Sanjay Sachdev,"Today your ads are way too long and keeps freezing, too bad I live in Asia region and the content sucks big time with low budget and sleezy movies. Thats the reason I never purchase the Plex Pass."
Estie Anna Ninon,Great Selections. Few commercials. Can't beat FREE!
Jesse knapp,So far at this point it's a nice app and good options for TV shows.
A Google user,"New ui is awful and confusing. Edit: it's getting even worse. When clicking on a TV show on mobile it's impossible to show episodes, stuck on-deck play ep 1:1?! No shortcut to 'show season' . Even when going through the library view it's like this"
Nathaniel Yancy,"I love watching the movies on Plex but there are certain movies I would like to see like assault on a queen with Frank Sinatra and 5 car stood with Dean Martin and Banning with Robert Wagner I see you got There Was a Crooked Man was Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda and Shampoo with Warren Beatty I like to see more movies like them, movies of the 60s and 70s and I like to see less commercials that you have on Plex sometimes the commercials are too long and if you can't let me know if you have Premium"
Michael Clair,to many old shows and movies üòÄ
Simply Tron,how do u make the screen bigger I can't see the whole video..
Lee Tran,"Plex's android app somehow never fails to disappoint. Crucial features are still missing (subtitle offsets), Plex forgets to send an HDR signal around 50% of the time, if even remembers to send a signal at all. I've had many a movie night delayed or outright ruined because of how inconsistent this app is, unfortunately everything else is even worse."
purnima jani,Excellent
Fred Maciach,great selection of shows.
Tim Y,"This app is hot garbage when casting to a Google Chromecast, at least when playing your own shows. The bugs are numerous. Here are a few. 1. More often than not it will not play a show when you click play. You have to disconnect and reconnect. 2. After a show has been playing for a few minutes, pressing pause on the app does not pause the show on the TV. 3. Sometimes when a show ends, instead of playing the next one on the TV, it will suddenly play it on my phone, even with the screen off."
Pearl Harris,I enjoy watching the old shows and new movies üòÅ
Guny Sadovsky,Great app!
Robert Spinella,"5 stars for being able to listen to my own music collection, but loses 2 stars for the non-existent playlist management. The only way to edit playlists at all is via web interface and even then, it's awful. Devs need to open up an older version of itunes to see how playlists are done."
Mel Waikaniwa,Awesome app to watch anything
J G,"This is not a streaming app. Instead, it tells you where you can stream and for how much $ Deleting! I didn't find your selection. Everything I tried to watch, was exactly as stated above."
Thabani Sibanda,beautiful
ramon lara,awesome love this app!
Robert Lefler,Works decent most of the time. a little slow loading though
KABIR Anderson,nice channel...wide range of topics
Sverre Munthe,There are way too many minor bugs in this app. I use Nvidia Shield and Sony Bravia.
Matthew Michalik,I LOVE to watch movies for free!
Tebo Tlhaloso,It's good.
Kieren Black,"Still quite a few bugs. Often restarts on Chromecast when I reopen the app on my phone. Also, sometimes when starring the next episode it starts playing on my phone, not the tv"
Sandra Russo,Absolutely the most useless app. Constantly won't load or play. Takes forever to play the ads and you have to fight with it and toggle back and forth. YouTube works this app doesn't.
Colin Walters,works on android 9 tv box
Daniel Klenda,it's not working right now
Larry Humphrey,Really good shows I don't know existed hope they show some more shows I like.
BEDFORD WITHERSPOON IV,"Shows a picture of Blue Bloods as though it's available on this app, which it's not and that IS misleading. I actually had to type in a search to find out. You can set it up to be alerted if and when it's available, but could wait a whole lifetime for nothing. They also have incomplete tv series on this app. If all the episodes are not available, why bother putting it in the app? Now 5 weeks later, I'm getting shut out as if my wifi's out. Update 1st time, 2nd time hour later, no access again."
Thiago Henrique,This app is useless without the Plex pass. You cannot stream anything for more than a few seconds. I don't even know why this is a free app. Make it a paid app here on Google store so people wont be mislead.
jamielee dirette,get movies almost as fast as they touch down w/o having to torrent and risk dangerous downloads
Andrew Stuckey,good selection of old b grade movies & almost forgotten TV shows. unlikely to find anywhere else.
G. Jones,luv it except for can't fast fwd the ads
Jon White,Superb. Movies and TV shows anywhere you go. Great concept. So far I've had no issues and am able to share my 900+ films while enjoying over 1500 more in the libraries of my friends. I can even play items recorded on my TV using DLNA technology. This is an awesome app. Love PLEX
KC Bills,"The app is complete garbage. Plex has become too concerned with other streaming services. I don't have other services, that's why I bought Plex pass for all of my family. And with this app I can only watch streaming services that aren't my Plex media service, even when on the same network. I would go negative stars if I could. I've spent so much on passes that I feel betrayed."
Graham King,I like it it's better on the laptop then it is on the smart phone some of the films get stuck which can be a nightmare but in all quiet good
James Brown,Good

Paul Fuller,"Everything was great until I lost Internet. My reason for plex! My wifi is still up, Plex refuses to work without communicating with the cloud.... That kind of defeats the purpose. If you are looking for an offline solution, this is not for you.... Just to be clear, I paid for plex, unacceptable. I would not have posted a bad review but there is zero support. Again, I paid for plex."
Miguel Berard,"love it, easy to use, configure, everyone in my family can enjoy it anywhere anytime on any of our devices, should have got it sooner."
Jacques Fourie,cannot watch a movie in peace. 2 minute long adds every 5 minutes. will not recoment this app to movie lovers.
Ted Tang,Switched to Plexamp for offline music. Download feature there works far better and can store on SD card. Uninstalled.
Roosevelt Jackson,I ‚ù§Ô∏è it.
Anthony Blanson,Asome
Larry Wayne,Having a problem with a American icon Hugh Hefner season 2 of girls next door 2 episodes are missing the ones with his birthday ü§îü§îü§î

Tinalee Rolen,awesome love it
Alexander B,"Plex is the best, I got the lifetime subscription and it's totally worth it."
Georgina Poey,I'm done thanks but not worth the headache ü§î
Jason Keithley,Really bad
Colin McFaul,The best app I've ever used
shane thede,works great but sometimes will fail if you rewind.
Mohammad,I love it
Carrie Jahsman,It doesnt even let you watch a movie it hust shows where u can buy them
Aimee Russell,"Watching strangers in danger finally can see this in uk! Was, great last night but today I continue watching and it thinks season 1 is awaiting release date but season 2 exists. If I go into s1 episodes I can watch season one, but the Japan episode is corrupted is is few minutes long (states so in the description)? Sorry dunno how else to report this seems no report button?"
niranjan s,Not working in my location and asking subscription for everything.... Download it is weast of time
Yarin Suissa,"the download feature STILL doesn't work for plex pass users, and if there were connection issues to your server, there isn't an obvious way to force the app to try to reconnect, except clearing cache in the os. other than that - the GUI and user experience is imho better than Netflix and all the other giants"
Susan Kobus,love love it
Harm Vorster,"The ads is irritating bud the content awesome and a lot better that what I paid for, thank you!"
Gunawan Sanjaya Mustofa,"Cocok untuk orang tua, kalau anak anak watching dora the explorer"
Punky Pete,"As an app it's very good, as a company it sucks. Great selection of movies, but the ads; oh boy. I appreciate that they need ads to keep running, but they are every 10 - 15 mins; and each one lasts between 2 and 3 1/2 mins. Their placing is awful. So expect one literally mid sentence. Even paid subscription on other streaming services, with ads, is not this bad. Only thing that let's Plex down"
Ms.Tawanna Espree,Free movies and tv shows.
David Bailey,it's excellent and all the movies I want to watch are free.
mark cody,to many commercials.
Michael Beltran,Fun for everyone
Sherif Ibrahim,so glitchy
James Novak,always something good to watch
Joshua Robertson,Only let's you watch certain movies
Michael Murphy,Great app
vishal anand,Wow
Bruno DOHM,"Even when you paid the lifepass, the android app is tracking you through multiple trackers to spy on you. This is ranging from google to facebook... and also appsflyer, firebase, admobs, crashlytics, etc, etc... Just a shame to be so unclean for such an app!"
vin,"Usually an excellent experience across all platforms but after the April 3rd update on the Nvidia Shield the Plex launcher launches the Plex app store page, not the app, most frustrating. Please fix ASAP"
Jonathan Marzullo,"Latest update 10.12.1.370 crashes app when switching to library tab. Especially for Plex Personal Media libraries. Clearing cache and app data, or uninstall, reinstall doesn't help. App is unusable now on Nvidia Shield Pro. Submitted bug report post topic in Plex support forum. FireTV Plex player app works fine. But 10.12.1.370 version broke and has bugs. Rolled back to last update from December 2023 version and app doesn't crash. Please fix. I am a Plex Pass member. Thanks"
Susan Slack,Keeps freezing up..
Miana Tomkinson,"Great app! I've found a nice selection of Brit crime dramas and golden oldies shows that I grew up with...but I do wish they'd tidy up their actor listings or give an option for a viewer to suggest a correction. I've found 3 separate pages for the same actor, and he's not even in the cast list of the main series he co-starred in that Plex has. Oh, and the commercials are repetitive. lol"
nelda blanco,love!!
Joran,Needlessly complicated and always trying to take you away from the core of the app which is just streaming your media to other devices well. I don't want plex pass I don't want suggested random stuff I just want to connect to my local server and steam
Gloria Walker,I love watching plex TV but too many commercials
Edgar Gonz√°lez,I totally enjoy this app to the fullest üëç
A Lance,"The media sever keeps losing authentication to the plex auth servers. The support article only fixes the problem for a very short time. And no acknowledgment there is a bug. Have had plex pass for several years and terabytes of content on the sever, but about ready to dump plex altogether."
Sandra Gause,cause it freeze up so bad
Kye,Doesnt actually let me watch shows or movies that aren't live without already having a subscription to a different streaming service that it could be on which is pointless because if I could already get it there I wouldn't be here
David,"App freezes after 5 of 6 commercials, will not resume... Tried everything."
Shaban Ansari,Jdud
Wayne Neidigh,great app.
Yousef Alkhal,I paid 1 month membership and they stole my money i cant see any movie
Nuno Sobral,"The versions since January crash on Nvidia shield pro, whenever I select the library tab. This issue is not solved in the april update. Can you please fix this? There are various posts about this on Plex Forum with the log files."
Duckers,"Reply to dev reply: I made a support post, got no answer in 5 days, tested new update, still greyed out next/previous episode. Main review: Too often unable to press next episode or previous as it's greyed out mid season, so have to end episode, go to series, tap season and then next episode. Helluva annoying than pressing next which is broken.. Also fix Plex addon to auto skip intros that your latest update broke.."
Nazir Shaik,it's good only thing is too much of advertising
David Crabtrey,great shows for FREE
JonKenneth Fontelar,OK
Arthur Dzuro,"Most of the time I want to watch something on my plex, I have to use the internet browser. This app does not work the majority of the time and won't show what's on my plex hard drive."
Hassan Syed,"I want a refund of 18 QAR paid for this awful app. I tried to use it, but nothing is working. The TV series available on plex can't be streamed. My WiFi connection is good enough to stream Netflix & Prime but not plex. I wanted to play the movies saved on my phone on TV through Plex, but It is extremely complicated to download & install plex Media server. Total waste of time."
Sk Maibur,Bauria
Jason Crews,It's just a distribution app
Josh,best app
AVP,"Crashes the phone as soon as you play a movie, screen cycles on and off, impossible to exit the app and the only way to stop it is to fully reboot the device. Please fix."
Ed P,Love it. keep up with making it even more better
Desiree DeJean,ENJOYED WATCHING NBC NOW. Had never even heard of this. THANK YOU!!! Will be watching daily ü•∞ü§óü§óü§ó
Josh Tonak,This app makes no sense. It says streaming but there are no channels to stream. I checked the boxes of the streaming services I have but it just says to pin sources.
Ricky King,1 to 10 I'll say 9 for good.
Rayane Madison,fake. we can't watch anything ü§¨
Storm Carter,I did pay for it but the adds kept coming up still would be nice if the adds could all be done in one shot
Per Simen Godal,Audio stuck on max and not possible to adjust. This has been a consistent problem for years. Edit: This is an issue on every android phone i have ever tried plex on. 5+ devices
Morayma Santiago,On Point üëåüèΩ
Troy Krauser,good deal.
Sean Moore,Offline download doesn't work. Whole reason I paid for this app...
Nagendra Uppara Nagendra,I'm already paid money all specification and payment done but no download option and without ads low education already amount is paid
Phyllis Parks,sometimes buffers a lot.
Shari K Tatum,I wish the ads weren't so repetitive. Still Love the variety of programming tho.
Kamogelo mahafa,Can't even watch
Linda Vinson,don't want them to know my info
Ken Jenkins,Excellent TVs-Movies app 5 ü§©
Rey,Does not allow to play video longer than 1min
Niki Smith,I hate the commercial buffering. Love Plex variety of movies.
Joel Wilc,I give this channel 2 stars. because this channel can't figure out we're in America.we speak English in this country. Not Spanish not Russian not French. English! figure that out and I bet you'd have better ratings! illegal immigrants are soon to be leaving anyway.thank goodness for that
James Gideon,Rubbish
Morty,"Since new update it won't load, it frezzes on startup"
Rhyan Adrian,goods‚Ä¶¬±¬•
Mohammed Hera,Nice app
Kerri Jordan,It's Better Than Nothing.
Benny Maxwell,is free and there's a lot of good movies and TV shows
Greg Holick,easy to use
Ron Poulin,"As an allaround media server, Plex is an incredible product. It is feature-rich and reliable. If you try it out, Plex-Pass is worth every penny."
John H.,"Adds come on and just spin. A 1 minute ad takes 10 minutes to play and then you have to restart movie. If I was advertisers ,I'd fire you and take business elsewhere. Plex is worst movie app on Google play."
JP Tissot,"the app was great, with some of the latest updates it became harder to navigate. I still prefer the old ui but works well"
J S,"Cable and satellite tv show too many sports, home shopping, or news channels. with Plex, I get to watch the stuff I enjoy."
Marz Arnold,Lots of various content and quality copies
Paul jacobs,not a 4 star or a 5
bill dcruz,so many ads
R C (Rob),"Cannot see the point for this app.... Tried to use it for about 15"", after building up more and more frustration towards this app, which seems to be just INDEXING films and recommend you Netflix or Prime to actually see them, decided to delete account and data and uninstall : shocker, cannot delete your account yet, you need to jump through hoops for that.... Well, not going to bash the service, however, if you ask for my recommendation, I would refrain from encouraging anyone else to install"
Junese Vicente,Okay
Robert Downey junior 420,Jai shree Ram ji
A Google user,I really like this Streamer with a myriad of films for every taste!
Tony G,They're on an account takedown spree
L·∫°i Tu·∫•n Anh,"Great app. I just hope that we also get there mobile sync feature for the 5 bucks we paid. EDIT: Took off a star since there are quite a few annoying bugs. First off, sometime the app just refuse to show your library until you restart it. Also, it's annoying when you open an episode on Continue Watching, but when you press the back arrow, it goes to Season screen instead of the screen you were at."
Murzinio,"Sucks, randomly doesn't connect for no reason"
Robyn Coote,Great content. My husband loves some of the older films.
Abraham Alex,App UI is not bad but this app keeps crashing then exits (closes) itself.
justin ruffini,"Specifically. At 720p, I've been attempting to dl 8 episodes of a show and 2 of another. Before even attempting, I had to clear data and cache to get app to say it was downloading. On full wifi, it's been 4 hours. I've successfully gotten the 2 episodes. Now that the 8 ep season shows nearly completed, the 2 episodes have gone back to qued. The last 7 % of the 8 episode shows a speed of 1.9-4 mbps. So at 720p, why has it not advanced in the last 30 min. Check reddit. Not new prob"
Eric Bader,two. thumbs up
Matthew Green,Fix offline download
Daniel Jordan,Its good for what I want tor need. Please add ability to adjust video playback speed like you have it on iOS
Cassie Mac,"Plex has a decent range of movies. I like that it shows all movies and showes, yet it's easy to see which ones are acctually on Plex. However the adds are outrageous. There are usually multiple adds at a time and take about a minute and a half for them to finish. I've also noticed that during the adds run time the app stops frequently to think. I've looked at my internet connection and there's no problem there. Hopefully they'll fix that. Overall the app is alright, but I definitely prefer Tubi."
Natalia Howell,some ads long
Rudy,wow
John Van Straalen,"When it works it's ok, crashes and stops playing frequently enough to be frustrating."
Donald Payne,"Could not turn off the live tv, Could not enjoy even looking for something else"
Melissa Terry,Don't know how to use it
Franklin Mahon,Plex TV is amazing and it's free and loads if channels and excellent EPG. Love it. Yes it is legal in the UK.
Nadhir Mohammed,Don't download
Steven Murphy,Plex is an amazing app for hosting my personal collection but also quality free content.
Thomas Pease,love it
Mitchell Desmond,Recent bugs in the original user part of the app make it unusable. Plex is too focused on their own strating part and the app is now useless because their streaming content is garbage
Michael Marcella,The channel guide wasn't working
Erwin Chavez,okies
victor lungaro jr,won't install
Lionel Fuller,I am loving it.
Audrey Wells,App starts out tries to play adds but cant. Wont play movie. Its got serious issues. I can play other movie apps. Tubi TV plays perfectly. Tecs need to fix this app.
Rosa Maria,Great movie options...saw new movies to me and the limited commercial time is nice too
kitt,Ok u can watch for free but can't find ones I searched for myself like Ruth Randall TV mystery or some UK detective programmes could be more content and less American ones in my opinion.
Laura Finch,"I have been very pleased with Plex. The selection are really very good as are the streams and the features are as good as any paid app. My Mom and I enjoy the British detective shows available. plenty of choices movies, shows all genres."
Rose G Rodriguez,9 freaking commercials to every 3-5 minutes! Pain in the patooty! I don't care if it's free it's so FRUSTRATING!!!!
Richard Bastiaans,Just love it
Charlotte Hutcheson,This app is amazing use it on a daily basis
John Stotz,Made it impossible to unsubscribe or alter subscription from the mobile app. So slimy.

Paul Meyer,Was very excited to have this because of the wide selection of movies but am very disappointed. Every time it cuts to commercials it pauses to load them. Have to wait sometimes at least 30 seconds for the commercial to continue. Can you please fix this?
Aubrey Forester,"I think it,s a great channel for all the soaps."
Dekster Narzo,"takes me 3hrs to watch 1hr movie due to several ads , each ads is 100+ seconds and hangs after. have to resume my app. omg unbelievable"

Llewellyn Goodwin,it's okay
Tom Scott,"Plex is great! But.... I'm having issues streaming from my server to my Google tv. Some files need to be auto converted to play with sound on my tv. I have to manually set it to automatically convert, every time I start a new episode. Plus, if I want subtitles as well as needing the auto convert, nothing happens. Like nothing. Auto convert+subtitles tells me my network isn't fast enough (it's 2.5gbe/wifi5 network) and just refuses to play. Doesn't matter the file, does it every time. Please fix"
Laura Sharp,the ads take forever to complete. They keep stopping. I do not have that problem with any other free movie app. It says 140 seconds for the ads. It has taken up to 1/2 hour to complete.
Prasenjit Dasgupta,a treasury of vintages
Sok Sreypov,"I don't know why tf do they even bother making the app at all if it doesn't even allowed you to watch the movie and it's a waste of time, at this point it should feel lucky that people even bother giving it one star"
Marcia Domer,"Was okay, until the c---_-------$&#@!?, decided they want you to share your watch history, even if your 61, a USA citizen , and have nobody else in ya house. They expect you to share with friends, with no way that can be seen with the option TO NOT SHARE, SO I UNINSTALLED THE APP. COULDNT DO ANYTHING! ITS LIKE A DEMAND TO SEE WHAT YOUVE WATCHED. LAST I KNEW ADULTS COULD WATCH WHATEVER THERY WANTED IN THIS COUNTRY...A-----NO WONDER TUBI KICKS YOUR A--!!!"
D Jelonek,"Needs work. Added this app too 2 phones, while the app works and get the job done, it takes over the phone when it crashes mes to videos. Take a video with your phone, access one on your network or such and Plex is the chosen playback option. Even if you try to alter this, Plex is still the playback default. Block permission to files and such, then you get a failure. Needs the he fixed so as only video in Plex use Plex for playback before I'll reinstall."
rick sinai,"Plex is the best Multimedia streaming platform available, not to mention functionality and ease of use."
Jose Reyes,great app!
Murad,Very bad app üòï
Daniel Waters,"When you click on ""Help and Support"", the is nothing there to click on. Why? I'm trying to add a new device, but an hour later I've gotten nowhere. Update : still no help nor any way to get help. I click on stuff at the shop-called""Plex help"", and there is nothing there! ? Doesn't make sense, but even at the forums, everything is old, closed, and didn't answer any questions"
Ismael Santos,I though u said free movies or am I sped?
Heidi Schreier,Like the free hallmark movies but the ads repeat so you should have a skip for ads
Derrell Durrett,"Server doesn't always stay connected during downloads, so many failures occur on play back. Download speeds are poor, despite being on the same LAN as the server. And playback sometimes fails even when the music is downloaded (doesn't appear to load ahead of playing). App data is 73GB plus 162GB of *cache*. Sometimes I can't open the playlist it says it has completely downloaded *unless I connect to the internet*! Please fix this! Takes forever to load. Pixel 8 Pro"
Shoo San,I paid for plexx pass but yet I can't play any movies!!!
Ejiro Olofua,"I don't understand why I can't watch movie video on this app,tl the app is just showing pictures of the movies not the video. Why is that, anytime I click on the movie I want to watch what I get is pictures not the movie itself"
Erin Walser,"Wish you didn't have to have the computer on to use the app to host your own movie collection but otherwise no complaints, fantastic app."
Vince Nguyen,"Doesn't work. Clear cache. Uninstall, reinstall. App doesn't load at all. Love that I bought the lifetime Plex Pass... Edit: Got it to work, but the app is a little glitchy and slow."
John - Paul Vassart,Janky application that only partially works
Kara Mercieca,"Went on a flight and tried to watch a movie on my phone. Constant errors and crashing. It's a local video file, it shouldn't be that hard. Android TV side is also not great, if there's a connection issue it requires a force stop to get the app to attempt reconnection."
Erik Lindquist,very full selection. worth the adds
Waleed Ahmad,PLEX:is a good app
Ed Verdi,not bad
Kelvin Lane,I like the movie
Shah Uddin,"Updated, rating to 4 star. Was buffering all the time but overcame this by manual app update in NAS server and updated files. All good but not a five star as would be good for Plex, qnap and synology to work on auto app updates to enhance the end user experience."
Rebecca Mackert,Great app I stream it on tv and there isn't all that many ads I don't like ads but it isn't that bad the ads. I would recommend this app to people it is like watching movies and shows on cable tv. Keep up the good work.
Brian Madden,This app keeps buffering on my TV but when the ads come on it doesn't do it could you please fix
DEBAJENA SEN,Too much poor...
House TVs,I am really sick of the crashes while seeking. and not sure why the loading issues with the continue watching section never seem to get better.you would think for one of the larger platforms this is probably on it would improve.

Sunshine Morris,"Have a very good variety of movies and shows.Up to date selection.Very good quality streaming,doesn't cut out or stop."
Hugo Kleinhans,"Plex helped me retake ownership of my media, so much so that I cancelled my Netflix subscription. Plus it gets all the show info and art for you, arranges them accordingly if your file naming conventions are okay (doesn't need to be specific) Have it setup to work offline for when your Internet drops, it's such a great app!"
Prince Winful,It doesn't even let you watch some movies like hazbin hotel
Sidney Reese,a Great App good movies and great service
Terry Prieto,"amazing amazing collection, after healing some intense surgeries, this stream app is a blessing. but we need more closed captions!!! even if they are generated. other than that, awesome app üëç"

K R (Kenta kunta kinte),Don't download this BS
Aheebwa Audrey,It doesn't have a server don't download itüòûüòûüòû
Jacob Darrah,"Originally I was drawn to this app becauae it would give me a better interface to browse and select my dvd movies stored on my hard drive that included poster art, there was a learning curve, especially with the music, but then they added streaming and the ability to share access to my library with friends, it continues to be exactly what I needed and with the premium fee I can access my movies from anywhere"
Julio Delaborda,"If you have it, you will love it!"
Shae 2009,"When i watch on Android i can watch Breaking Bad, when i go to watch it on my ipad its not there on your app to watch- theres no synchronicity? -please fix this issue"

Nanny Janny,good no ads but with love series it doesn't show
Julien Sero,Broken downloads....for yeaaaaars
Tyler Palomaki,Simple and effective. Was already installed on my seedbox. One time mobile fee is fair.
Ruth Caruana,How can i watch the movies for free
Steve C,I think this is really good. better than the other ones I've tried much better and not so many commercials to watch to watch commercials for a minute 30 to watch a movie I recommend this anyone that wants to watch a movie and just have to every half hour 15 minutes or so like a commercial wake up commercial for a minute and 30 seconds sometimes it's not even a minute so I choose to watch that for now on.
Arun Sharma,Any Live episode movies in TV another device
Allen M. Whitey,Badazz !Loveit!
Serge Lutskov,"I Love everything about this app, just marvelous ‚ô•Ô∏è"
red fury91,When the volume of these jump-scare commercial breaks are 10 times louder than the regular programming it becomes unbearable to watch
Mack Miller,Fix the offline download feature. Stop trying to make this into a streaming service. Focus on the users who have paid you money instead of making false promises and ruining your service.
Rod ‚ÄúNutty Rob‚Äù Robinson,It's incredible.
Sanjaya Gebrial,Great app but the search functionality is completely useless. Shows me stuff that's not even in my library.
Mandla langa,Perfect
Gale Hopping,Awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Levi Travis,"Plex as a service? Amazing. My experience with Plex on literally any other device? Flawless, barring some user error. The Android app is quite literally non-functional. Several of its main features simply do not work. This has been the case for me for several months."
Steve Nash (r2steve2),"Due to the fact that I was running out of space, physical space for all of the DVD cases and CD cases etc, I found Plex many years ago and spent about a month using handbrake to copy everything over. This is the best thing I have ever done since learning how to slice bread. In the meantime, I have never had a single problem with the drobo raid I used to store all of the media and with the bandwidth I have at home, I'm able to watch together with friends on days we can't be in the same location."
John Wellman,it's okay but doesn't always stay on loses connection and I will say has better movies . And has a few good live TV shows
Jerry Moore,really good application
Iain L,works great for streaming!
smooth man,It works wonderfully
Erica Ivy,ILikeIt
Lan Hikari,"I wish this app didn't suck so bad. Still bad in 2024, pixel 6a. BAD! Im on version 6.11, the most stable version of the app for 2 years. This app just keeps getting worse for the core functionality. Update: Updated for the Plex download feature, and it doesn't work! Trash!"
Johan Jonker,"Almost usefull, works way better on the web interface. No point in downloading."
blanche jackson,nice movies
Subtle Blade,"reasonably reliable app, but the content is mostly meh..."

Ranks Abiodun,No current movies
Regan Reigns,how l wish ue could add the captions option this app would be the greatest
Fraser,It crashes during every advert break. So you have to restart the film and find where you left off. Which is very frustrating.
Pappu RAVI,"good , but if it is without ads, it is best site"
Tyler sheggz Ayodeji,Why is it that most Nat geo wild doucumentaries and movies and tv shows are not on demand only caught in the act and africa's super seven and pls i need you guys should put all nat geo wild movies and tv shows on demand For me without those nat geo wild movies and tv shows (plex tv is boring) pls you should do something about it thank you
Kisses Mine,Very bad lots of ads
Talisha Rose,I like everything about it accept the ads but everything else cool
Alex Vosper,I download the app for my roku tv the app is just as good as tubi app 70% of the same movies/shows alot are different but worked good till I had put on a movie and had to watch 7 ads in a row every 10-15 mins of the movie I understand the need for ads but abit much.. thanks.
Sapna Patel,"I'm not sure why some things cast to Chromecast but others don't. They skip or buffer. Sometimes when something is casting, it can not be stopped even if you exit out of Chromecast and Plex. I've had to just unplug Chromecast. It's weird. Other than that plex is ok. The files that play, play properly, but many files don't play or give error messages even if my WiFi is strong."
Fernando Socas,"I use.plex a lot, on the server, the tv, the PC, the PS4, and I recommend it. But on mobile it is very uncomfortable and unstable. Trying to play media crashes the system UI on my Android 12 and I have to restart the phone. Unusable in this state"
Luke Hazell,Nothing will play longer than 30 seconds without it sending you back to the home screen. The app works great on tv and computer but is a horrific mess on android
Steve G,"Recently began hanging in an ad, and not continuing the video stream."
Amanda Small,This app is great. I never haveany issues watching the content. No delays andthe picture quality is perfect.
brandon cleveland,if this were family library it would receive 5 stars. use it only for local streaming.
Randy Gallow,I love it because I simply appreciate that I can watch a movie for free
Tony Melendez,so far so good!!!
Owen Genzlinger,"the old download sync was world's better than the new one. but since Plex is more worried about streaming services, I guess the home library users are just SoL."
Evgenii Bunevich,plex is game changer for home video collection.thank you for getting better through the years
MJ O'Donnell,it's not bad
Ant on,"Gratis och mycket att kolla p√•, lagom med reklam"

Kevin Sink,Awesome movies!!
Dwayne Watson,The app keeps stopping during streams.
Louis-Willem van Niekerk (IconicDawn),"I only discovered this app recently and I love it. It executes it's functionality beautifully and provides exactly what it set out to provide. I would rate it 5 stars, but there are still a few bugs which needs to be fixed. Other then that, all around excellent app!"
Deanna Espinoza,great shows thank you üíØ

norvell currie,"This app sucks! once the adds are finished, the app locks up. It is extremely frustrating.I didn't even want to give it a one star rating, but couldn't proceed without doing so."
Jasmine Younger,COINS MONEY
Jesse Ferrer,It's okay üëç
carly wales,lots of choice tv and movies good variety üëç
James Drew,"Rubbish. Apart from the fact that pretty much everything is American drivel, the one show I wanted was only available by signing up to Discovery at great expense. Absolutely nothing on the live channels that interested me without signing up to paid platforms, and if I had signed up to a paid platform such as Discovery, then why would I need Plex?"
Tiyamike Ziyadi,The most useless app don't subscribe it does not allow you to delete your account and it just says where to watch like netflix but it does not let you watch anything so it's completely useless
Laura Willis,great movie selections
Joe Glende,"Very creepy, sends emails to all your friends with a list of shows you've watched. Massive invasion of privacy. Looking for alternatives now."
Robert ‚ÄúBurner‚Äù Macfarlane,"pluto crashes screen constantly , waste of time"

Blighty Roo,Playback doesn't work
Priansh Patel,Just distraction. Nothing else is here than few content. This is not for indian users.
Wendy C Schroeder,Great tv on the go
James Schraw,"Uninstalled within 4 minutes of use.. windows app and my shield work great with accessing my local library, but the phone version stops playback every 30-45 seconds and kicks me back out to the library menu.. can't even watch 4 minutes of one of my videos without 8 or more interruptions due to the app stopping playback for no reason and with zero interaction from me (wasn't even holding my phone at the time) won't be using the phone version of this again. (It was installed on aPixel 6 Pro)"
Andy Phelps,"I paid for Plex Pass and downloaded this app specifically so I could download videos to my phone for offline viewing. Unfortunately, this promised feature is not actually available, as any effort to download your video leads to the message ""an error has occurred, please try again later"". Thats all it says, no actual info on what the problem might be. There is no reliable fix. I've since learned that this issue has been ongoing for at least two years. They know about it. They don't care."
Thomas Taylor III,I love the variety of free movies!!!
Chrispy 22,love this my own Netflix that actually can watch movies that are good :)
Matthew Schwartz,"The best for streaming media from anywhere. $5.00 for the app, good deal!"
mc ef,"I have found PLEX to be the absolute best method for managing videos and streaming choices and keeping a well organized library complete with PLEX added movie, TV, and streaming extras, such as trailers and reviews and a host of other interesting & useful extras. I kept trying movie organizers for years, wondering why they were so lacking in providing an easy to use method for organizing my media. I've been happily using PLEX now for over 2+ years. Look for a free trial. See for yourself !"
Francesca Layton,"Can't watch anything on the app, it just plays for a few seconds then shuts off"

Tom Blackwell,Works good for free so far
David Anderson,Never ending buffering during advertisements. Error message says error in advert loading. No support whatsoever from Plex.
Robert H,Works for what I want it to do. Worth the price for the upgraded version.
Steven ‚ÄúScuba Steve‚Äù Hildebrant,Best personal media content management system ever created
Lockinhind,some issues with naming in pc but otherwise great service
Felim Clarke,Free to watch plex on iOS but you have to pay to watch longer than 1 minute on Android. Noting but a bunch of money grabbing bastards!
Daisy Duke,good for watching with others but they should make all shows shareable because not all shows are
Ravinder Paswan,This app is good That I am very nice pic to do with you üòç I am very happy with the best üíã in the day üòÑ I have a lot of the best of the day you are my favourite person
Henrique Tschannerl,The best media server and application. I've been use it for more than 10 years
v10l3ntb0b,"Works well, doesn't crash. Streaming media from my home server doesn't buffer at all and keeps me entertained while I'm at work. If you already have a running Plex server then getting the app set up is as easy as signing in to your account. Hard not to recommend this honestly"
Derrick M,Forced ads that are 30 minutes in length is completely beyond acceptable. I do not care about the journey of hearthtrust or life.churchs ceos or founders.

Jason Cadman,exelent app.. few adds but completely worth it.. you can't expect a completely free app to not have adds
Alex Torge,"It almost never works. Tried to watch an episode that I started on WebOS, and it doesn't start. Tried to watch another one that I started in the app. It works until I change the subtitles, after which it gets stuck in loading"

Euqinahs Nnihp,No location currently available for me to watch a simple movie????
John Taylor,good
talby 0,Not sure how its ease of use will stack up
Joe Miller,"It has some good old series I haven't found elsewhere. The problem is the ads. Not that there are too many. It seems the same number as any other free streaming app. The problem is the ads freeze repeatedly. A ""2 minute"" commercial break takes more than 5 minutes to play. It's ridiculous."
Michelle Sebastian,Isn't plex supposed to be free tv yet it is asking me to pay to watch supernatural my favorite
A Google user,So far so good. A little long on the advertising.

Jay Davis,"What the heck is this shady carry on now days? You don't need that much device information on anyone, the app is so buggy and laggy I don't see how anyone favours this over Jellyfin or even VLC to be honest. Deleting this app and putting plex on my no fly list and pi-hole."

andrew white,loved Plex. but doesn't work on this phone like at all. it's become an extremely rare treat. haven't gotten it to work all day. as it asked me to review the app I was just about to try it again. but I know it's really just going to crash my phone

Marci Leivas,yes I will

Tron Elec,Nice app
Frances Piazza Richards,I love the program s
Michael Cofer,"app is not bad. There are a few hangups. The channel guide doesn't work. You get an error when you click on it. Also if you attempt to watch a movie, the ads are often and long. Too many interruptions."
ganga moni tudu,This app is the worst app I have ever seen.
Reena Singh,"When I search other series like Wednesday, it does not give the option to play then how am l supposed to see it. That's the only problem. Otherwise this app and it's functions are truly awesome"

Rochelle Austin,Enjoy
Klaas Van Praet,"with streaming services getting worse and asking for more money, plex offers a way to show we are fed up with it, while still watching our favourite shows."
Victor M Duran Jaramillo,well spent money lifetime member
James O'Shea,"TOO MANY ADS!!! I only downloaded this app after attempting to watch a movie with my brother and having 6-7 ads EVERY 10 MINUTES, so that I could tell people how bad the experience was"
Victor Ude,Really unreliable lately. Subtitles won't load for anything. Playback is frequently interrupted. Can't remotely access servers that have worked for months. Not sure what's going on but it's getting to be untenable.
Elizabeth Harlan,"It is easy to use. Also has a very large channel selection, I think everybody would be able to find something to watch"
D Best,The amount of ads is unaccectable . totally spoils the movie. Approx 2 mins every 5 mins... Too much even though its free. Poor selection of movies
David G,"Performance was awful, it caused my cricket debut smart to flash (upon tapping a movie, between the app, and my home screen. My phone then crashed I had to restart my phone to stop the screen flashing ."
Nathan Roden,Good app for the most part. Playback will start to lag if you pause and resume on android for some reason.
Jimmie Hilderbrand,love this site
Regina Edwards,it's good
John Mcmillan,love it even though I would love to see a better and more choice of movies
anthony matthews,depending on. Internet it's simple and good Adverts get a bit annoying but it's ok
Nitin Sharma,brightness adjustment feature on screen
Pamela Harnage,You get more ads than you do the movie you're watching. I have Pluto TV and Tubi. They have ads but not like this. More movie less ads. Uninstalling
Thai,I like it very much
Daniel Carrera,amazing if you know how...
Bryan Perez,Own your own server. Why the Frick not?
Andrea Fisher,Excellent
Randy Gallow,it's a good app to watch movies on
dororhy howe,I can watch what I want
Obianuju Ubah,I hate this app you can't ifin download a single movie this app is just üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé I am just üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° if I was your manager I fill fire the person that could not even make An app to download for that I am only giving u one ‚≠ê
Jon Konawalchuk,"this app is awesome, lots of movies and shows that the big streaming services ignore"
Juan Cortez,"really happy with it, great movies"
PetrusJohanHendrik Booyens,"Not user friendly, cant see nothing that good. Not for people that choose or want to have access to any entertainment, but must first pay. What happen for first month free, this platform to rich for me. But thanks for one episode I did watch with out need to register to pay."
Michael Bridson,"The ads get a little annoying, but for a free movie app it's great. An ever growing library too. Also, it seems quite intuitive when suggesting films you might like by judging your past viewing. Love it !"
Michael Nelson,works like a charm
Jason Marcus,App is pretty broken. It's slow to start and stops playing videos complaining about my Internet connection even though the videos are on my local storage. Not just videos but recordings done with the phones camera and my phone is only a year old.
alex cortez,love all channels undiscover discovery
Tam Law,love all the older movies I never had time to watch but now do - thanks Plex
Fabien Wernli,I preferred the older version. And please stop forcing people to upgrade!
Bogdan Pop,Nice
Bruce Baskin,"Can't get Pluto TV in the Philippines without VPN but Plex is the next best among multichannel apps and they're improving. I downloaded it mainly for Glory Kickboxing but there's a decent selection of other channels, many of them second-tier but enough variety to make Plex work for me. P.s. Wu Tang Collection has become a guilty pleasure with their ""so bad it's good"" chopsocky movies that make the willful suspension of disbelief a fun thing."
Victor Mulenga,It is a cool to use
Ocean,"They fill my need of viewing pleasure! It's a treasure, GO TEAM PLEXüòÅü•≥"
Mr. Smith,Can't access live TV from the home page. It gives an error code every time. Plex is getting worse and worse. I'm to the point I'm going to dump it. Not even worth local channels any more.
Da Cm,Plex only gets worse over time. It's gone from a top choice with the best transcoding available to the worst app interface imaginable on Roku and Web. It literally hides your own Plex media server by default as they shove more and more Plex streaming content in your face. Time to make a change.
Patricia Smith-Rice,It's still so really easy to see everything in one place.
Terren Trousset,Used for years. Bought lifetime. Love it.
Ivan Omarra,Dose not let u watch movies app sucks
Sam Smith,Really great programing just needs NEW quality scifi programs
Tiffany Branch,This app only shows trailers and has a description of the movies and TV shows not long length movies or TV shows.
Cory Raymer,"Ads ads ads, and it can't even play them all the way through, lol"
Bryan Morano,Not working just says pin source
Paula,it's good
johnny ceaser,love watching and so many channels
Cayden Harrison,Can't not watch flims
Jermain Anderson (Jermain Allen),"Plex still has an amazing amount of potential, but ultimately the application falls short, as it still relies on web links to play content from many of the ""integrated"" applications. That means content from Google Play and Microsoft Store will not accurately play based on the type of device that a person is using. If it wasn't oddly disappointing, I would say it's ironic that the application for Google Chromecast can't open the Google Play Store."
Troy Martin,"I use Plex often for streaming my media server, casting from device to TV. Recently the stability of the app seems to have dropped. Sometimes it lags and buffers more than before, sometimes it fails to pick up the server. Up until a couple of months ago I had no issues with it."
halfnekojames,Stay away from plex. Their support team considers actual problems rants and wont help you. The app as u can see is unreliable. It does not stop on just mobile devices.
FAG FUN,Why we cant watch wwe
Derek Wright,"I get check connection on every other movie\tv show on my pixel tablet. Which seems to be the Plex ""go-to"" error for everything. Not expecting any help, Plex support seems to be the ""ignore the customer"" model while linking to a forum. This is all with the pro pass subscription."
gerald martinez,All good
Brandon Udey,Great quality found movie that no one else had adds were just a little long
David Reichard,some of my favorite series

Vincent Simelane,great and awesome
Louise Woodcock,I love Plex. there's always something to choose.
Johnny McCaleb,"I like hearing about the weather when it happened.Unfortunately, like some other channels, they do more commercials than they do.The weather.Thank you"
Smokie Peters,it's the best app for movies
Surajit Talukdar,"Nice collection of movies. But add more different movies than Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, etc. All the best, Plex."
c p quigley,good but not great connecting to Sonos
Jake VanBlargan,I like üëç
Darren Glover,"As of March 13th 2024, the march 11 update appears to have broken live tv for managed and Plex account home users that are not the admin. Please fix this"
SJ,does nothing
Brian Chamberlain,Watching amovie then ad error
Mister Numb,Made a server for my family and we love it!
Gym Ellipses,"You know those turds on Youtube who literally STEAL other people's videos from all over the net, & repost them on their' channels, then sit back, and collect the penny/watch, or the ones who make lying videos about stuff that just isn't true (Like putting aluminum foil balls soaked in cooking oil in the microwave for 10 mins, frying anyone who tries it's oven), yet saying it's not only true, but doctoring up the videos to con people into COSTLY losses? This is the app version of them!"
Chioma Okafor,"very good app ,but much ads"
John Cusick,"Up until the most recent update, I've enjoyed this application. But since the update, the Channel Guide no longer functions even after an ""uninstall"" and ""re-install."", on a Samsung Tab S7. The error I am getting is ""The file associated with this item is not accessible by the server."" It would be nice if this was repaired quickly. Otherwise I would have given this 5 stars. Followup: Apparently others are also having the same issue, but no solutions to this bug have been offered on the forums."
Marc Baker,i enjoy it
British Printmaker,"üéØüëçThe BEST NO.1 GO TO app BETTER than SKY & Now TV with thousands of FREE movies & documentaries to watch on Plex itself in GOOD QUALITY with no buffering; DEFINATELY TRY primewire.mx FREE movie website If you have a secure internet connection to your device, the PLEX lifetime membership fee is worthwhile for upgrade...."
Jerwin redona Celario,Im happy to watching movies
Penni Lawrence,How could you ever go wrong with Plex? It's the best thing that ever happened to TV
Judy Howe,Server error when it comes to the channel guide. Can you fix it please?
Dan Skrivseth,"The Download feature is buggy at best. It doesn't work consistently, frequently sits at 0 percent. When it does it transcodes downloads despite the defined settings in the app being original quality (download) but if I stream the same file it direct plays. Also, skipping ahead while streaming frequently crashes the app. Plex for Windows is somehow much, much worse. Don't make the same mistake I did, avoid Plex, find an alternative."
David Johnston,it has all the old movies and shows. I love it
renee pangborn,I love this app
Mike,love this app!
Lord 1o1Justin Edwards,Me gusta por es muy deportes y peliculas.

Herbert Bean,fake app üò°üò°üò°üò°
Nave Wilson,Doesn't work at my region
j rod,plays same season over and over again but it's still cool for free
Mike Ngubane,best entertainment app ever. Fully loaded
Anthony Winslow,"Plex has lost its way. Opt out viewing history with my shared libraries is a no no. This among other issues have finally pushed me to start using JellyFin. Yes JF is missing some amazing features that Plex has, such as file optimization, but it runs completely locally and doesn't try to reach out of my network for any reason. Good luck Plex, you have lost me as a supporter..."
Sean Rosekrans,I am extremely disappointed in this app. There are more commercials then actual show. When commercials play they break up or stop taking forever to get back to show. Nice choice of shows but the commercials make it unusable for me.
Chris and Mike Duggan,good morning and the new year is the last
George Jardine,So much choice and the adverts don't intrude too much. More amazing is that it's free.
Muhammad Tabrez,Very bad
Mohd Nazri,owesome for freeüòä
Brian Gamble,"was fine until the last update but now crashes if you try to change tabs, say from recommend to library"
Ronald D. Sproles,Had too much excess on my Google account
Daniel Dainty,What an amazing home media server system! Update: audio player needs some refinement. Android Auto support is very poor. Audiobooks don't remember where you left them.
Laverne Fairnot,love it.
Taire Williams,its a great app only need option we need to be able to download and more updates and music vides to watch
Chris Mcmorris,it is ok
Rebecca Chick,very good app
Rob Lewis,A good selection of a variety of movies.
Gavyn Young,"Adverts freeze/buffer and take 10 times longer. Makes a 46 minute episode double. Had to stop in the end... Shame, lots of nice choices."
Joe Larsen,cable experience but there's always something you know you like on
jordel2010,"This mobile app still isn't as good as its desktop counterpart, and has gone from mediocre to bad. It crashes, it lags, video playback stalls and stutters... Pretty badly! Its fairly decent catalog of movies, that's about the only positive I can point out regarding this mostly awful app."
RYAN LOPEZ,to many commercials and it's takes 2 1/2 minutes
Linux Lover,Audio and video never sync
Old Hillbilly,great movies. great selection.
Kevin Shaw,"Just watched first film on plex, unfortunately even though free 2 1/2 to 3 minutes of ads every 15mins makes it unwatchable yeah yeah I know terrestrial tv does the same and u choose not to watch that either but at least during films they do ads every 30 minutes not 15."
Priyang Patel,good
Brian Lynch,Very good and easy to use
Dr. Gogu,please fix transcoding simple mp4 h264 for files stored locally on Shield. it should Direct Play
Daniel Sprouse,I have a few videos that have encodings that don't work on my smart TV. pretty much makes them useless
John Prudhomme,I enjoy watching something different than the standard fare. The show always plays completely without issue in good quality.
chris jackson,"Plex doesn't have it all, but it'll help you find it elsewhere."
Miss P,This app is very good and I'm grateful
John Joseph Quinn,media server............ that is all.........
Freddy Fazbear,I can't watch my favourites like hazbin hotel and fnaf
Patrick Fisk,Very good now. I am using an android box on 5G with a bluetooth mouse and controller. The plex grafic user interface is very well thought out. Program choices are diverse and abundant.
Andrew Wehmann,I use Plex Media Server and downloaded this app on my Sony Bravia TV so I could view photos and watch home videos taken on our iPhones or iPad. For some reason videos always play sideways. You can (every single time) go into the ... menu and manually change the video quality to 720P to get it in the right aspect ratio but then it is stretched and distorted in landscape. There is some kind of problem with it being able to play videos in portrait. Works on all my other devices no problem.
Punky Monkey,Worst app to pay anything for.
James Woods,"excellent,I was able to view whilst on holiday in Spain..great shows"
joevans27,Tried using this on ny TV a while back but didn't seem work right. Put it on my phone other night and it's got a great selection. Some cult classics. I mean I already own most of them on dvd. But fir people that dont you've got some hits here.. also a selection of vintage ones I have nostalgia for on here which I was really pleasing. Downside to many adverts and they get placed at bad scene points
Bloody Ace Gamer,Still app was crash again 'n again...
Juninho Greenspan,still lag when streaming from personal server
Eli Ben-Moshe,I use it only for seeing where content is streaming. I don't understand why it doesn't support Disney plus...
Kapu Muang,Useless app üò°üò°üò†üò†
Mihaly Szabo,I love it easy to use and got multiple options settings to make it work with a slow Internet speed also
Leon Shambo,Good
Vicki Creekmore,I keep gettoing error message every 7 to 10 minutes and there is no one to fix it. Sent a message to no reply email online. Two stars is best I can do right now.
Garrett Hurd,shorty service always buffers
Lex Python,"Works 60% of the time, and crashes. Was hoping to replace streaming but it's just not reliable. Uses a lot of my Internet sometimes for no apparent reason. I loved it but then it got very buggy and now I haven't been able to use it in three days. It was worth a try I guess."
Thomas Peck,Absolutely horrible streaming experience. I can't get past commercials. I'm done with this app. I've been trying to watch Earth Final Conflict and cannot do so due to pestilent ads. Sayonara Plex!!!.ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üñï
Robert Chapman,Despite what others say...if they are saying it? PLEX IS FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!!
Billy Ray Swearengin,"awesome variety of shows picture vision bright and clear very easy to find something all,keep up good job!"
Fred Shirk,Plex has become the only app I use. I collect videos and radio shows and Plex allows me to access them all‚ù§Ô∏è
Chris Van Mill,Works about half the time. Streaming function is pretty terrible. Wish there was another option but there isn't.
David DeBernardi,Terrible app - only watched 5 minutes of one movie but had to watch ads before and after the 5 minutes that lasted longer than 5 minutes - who would put up with that- no one - ridiculous . Also they said they had a movie to watch but all they did was refer you to a different site to rent or buy - misleading - can't see why anybody would download this app
Dan Chamley,It's good. Can you please update this app so I can watch the crocodile hunter shows on plex in Australia thanks. I don't use DVD players or DVDs.
Chip Clermont,way too fussy and inconsistent
Marco Abis,"2 minutes and a half of ads in a movie multiple times. Is it a joke? ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ Uninstalled in the middle of a movie, I couldn't stand it any longer."

Dana Fashina,"App is constantly in spin-mode. Trying to cast from my phone to my TV, using the same Chromecast feature (almost) every app has - that seems to confuse the hell out of this app though. She just stays in spin-mode on the app with nothing but the title loading on the TV. I do not know why I have this app. Deleting immediately."
Sashona Brown,too much adds but this is a nice app
Chocolate River Yarns & Fibres,adverts aside...good stuf!
Arnie C,Great Entertaiment! Thank You Plex. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thomas Santillan,"Knocked down to 2 stars. Downloading a season of a TV series. Even though multiple episodes have finished downloading, I can't watch them until all downloads have completed. **edit** Knocked to 1 star after the app got stuck on the lat episode. After closing Plex and then re-opening, it decided I needed to re-download the season all over again. Absolutely terrible."
Junior,garbage
Q tv,Every movie old ü§£ü§£
R F,Absolutely terrible. No subtitles. Which is a must. Even if it was CC. Also why only have a subtitles for 1 episode but not the other 19. Ridiculous this day and age. Subtitles should be mandatory. I am deaf. And I cannot rely on your service. So goodbye. Uninstalled. (PS maybe give an option of only showing which ones actually has the subtitles. I may come back then) please do not respond with an automated machine.
John Chapman,"For years and years, I have wanted to see that great and sad movie, ""To Kill A Mocking B√≠rd."" Thanx to Plex, I finally got to see it. QUESTION: Why are some video aps able to play advertisements without any problems, and other apps just can't get it right?"

Yung Capital,I'm not happy
Otieno Owino,What is wrong with you people? How can spend 23 out 24 hours a day trying to stream on the app and website and all I keep getting site unreachable? When is it reachable? When are your servers working?

Paballo Maluleke,"Too slow to load not all functions or features appear like the previous version,it takes time to play"
Claudia Naris,Not as easy to navigate as the first app. For instance when you're done watching something or don't find it interesting you can't remove it from the continue watching list. I also don't know where they dug up that old horrible dinosaur movie. Tubi has better movies and it's free.

Sanda Babagana Abbas,"I have had a terrible experience with showmax. The appropriate word to call you guys is "" fraud."" I subscribed to you last month, but I can't watch a movie. It always shows ""showmax isn't supported in my region"" while I'm still in Nigeria. I deleted the app because of this technical failure, yet you guys still debit my account for your monthly subscription. What have i watched in my first subscription? Please refund my money or work on my account, or I will tarnish your image online."
chantel changela,love it

Emailed them over a week ago and no reply by a human and problem persists Also, why can't you remove shows from the ""continue watching"" section on the new Showmax app? Additional problem, after minimising the app halfway through an episode it will sometimes not save where you left off."

Joshua Muga,"freezes, restarts shows, times out at any opportunity. Garbage app you can do better guys."
Nombuso Malefo,"Terrible viewer experience. It's hard to search for new shows, it's not easy to manouver through shows. The suggested shows should pop up as trailers and allow the user to choose rather than play automatically because there is no option to remove the show. We have to find the last episode of the very last season and run it till the end to remove an annoying show from our list of shows to continue watching. This is unacceptable, i can't imagine that the app was tested from a viewer's perspective."
Marea,This new app is terrible to the core!...the old app was just perfect there was no need to introduce a new app.

No more champions league, None of all other leagues only EPL..... No more local stations.... And your movies are no where to be compared to those of the Netflix..... Very appalling.....

crad Daniel,I paid 2900 ..and I can only watch premier league..I can't watch movies ..scam
Anita de Jager,"""Something went wrong"" is the summary of the experience we have had using this app. Even though it works okay on PC and phone, we've had 0% success watching anything on our smart TV.

Michiel Mashava,best thing to ever happen @Showmax
Charlotte Jessica,Slow response
Byron Marais,DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR SIGN UP!!! This is a HUGE SCAM!!! Some features that are paid for cannot be viewed properly and the entire viewing system for European premier league is ABSURD. I can't screen mirror even though I'm using my own showmax account. And besides the premier league there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to watch. Needs huge attention and to be more upfront with their package deals. HIGHLY DISSAPPOINTED !!! I have way more fun on Netflix and youtube. This entire platform seems somewhat useless.

Reneiloe Maile,show max it's a great app and even though it doesn't have many shows it's great but if you want a western or Korean show like it doesn't have any
andre usher,Do better!
Pieter Swart,"Good and bad. Good is general ease of use. Documentaries the biggest draw. Bad is the little things. For some reason, you cannot skip 10 or 20 seconds at a time, it fast forwards like the old VCRs. So now I have to rewind again if I just want to skip a few seconds and it went too far. Please fix this. Constant freezing is very annoying. You lose a star. Subtitles also very inconsistent - for some episodes of the same series it works and not for others. 'Skip intro' should be on all series."
Lesego Segopolo,It's giving.
Astrid Van Der Schyff,"So i have a premium DSTV package and Showman is for free on that package. Since the new Showmax, I've been struggling for 2 months to sign in.

Chiri Tuiyot,"The new app is very difficult to use. Apart from lack of trailers, the descriptions for most shows are off. The search using genres is the worst search I have ever experienced. Tell me why when you search the comedy category 3/4 of the results are anything but comedy? And the kids stuff is just annoying. Getting so many recommendations for kids' shows on a normal profile. With all this still the most annoying thing has to be the fact that you cannot remove a show from continue watching."

I don't have a problem with the content, the biggest issue is this new design!!!! It's a nightmare or all platforms, worse on Android TV, if it's not the app lagging and freezing, it's the inability to search or find what you are looking for. You can do better guys COME ON!!!"

Useless app."
francis ndung'u,If you don't wanna loss your money don't try the new showmax. I paid my monthly subscription but it could watch since it didn't reflect. The customer service couldn't help on that. They promised to refund and they didn't. I wasted a whole monthly subscription and didn't use it.

Rose Kara,Horrible am not able access the shows even though I have the app and am signed in it keeps searching.
Chris Owen,"Showmax's sports content is a welcome addition, bringing variety for sports enthusiasts. However, adding SuperSport channels for past games, especially from prestigious tournaments like the Champions League and Premier League, would significantly enhance the platform's appeal, especially weekdays.

TsatsiPertunia071 Mokgobi,"This app is so slow and it's just a complication of the things that were easy in the first app. With series downloads you find that episodes are not in order and I cannot tick all and delete at once, i have to delete one by one. The continue viewing part as well is just a mess. Now the only option available is to continue with the episode or where you left off. There's no icon to give you other options like open the series and download other episodes."
Mthabisi Nyoni,My showmax is kicking me out l dn know wht
KEVIN WANJALA,"I have never seen a Movies app so pathetic. i mean everything is such a mess, a series with more episodes you are forced to watch all the credits of each and every episode. it cant skip to the next episodes not untill you watch every credits üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ you cant also skip the introduction part of the episodes like the previous app. üòè this is not cool.

Bheki Machika,"I keep receiving a Play error stating that screen mirroring is not allowed on my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. I've checked my settings, and everything appears to be in order. Showmax, you're disappointing. All you do is respond by saying you're escalating the issue. If you were taking this seriously, you would have sent notifications or emails immediately when you noticed errors from multiple users. Have you checked the rates? See what makes you so bad. Don't just consider the number of people subs"
Wayne Dube,Rubbish
Tammy MDawarima,"Not user friendly at all. The old app was much more convenient, making it easier to navigate between shows. Also the sports shows being restricted to just Premier league the heck?! Please just do us all a favour and bring back the old showmax, or prepare for a major downfall with lost clientele."
Don Francisco Martins,Can't view any live match since I installed this new version. And it freezes sometimes. And ofcoz I can relate to the other user's reviews. Don't want to talk too much. Please fix this. It's been going on the whole of February

Stevie Kotze,"There is no wonder as to why dstv is losing millions of customers a year. Wasting money on a new app that doesn't work. Great initiative to promote sales with the added sport, but bad implementation. New update is horrible, Half of my downloads have fatal error messages with no trouble shooting option or support nevermind how limited the new display is and movement within the app is actually trash. Please either revert to previous versions or fix this updated rubbish."
Randy Smit,Great app but it's frustrating that I can only download 3 episodes at a time. Thinking of unsubscribing.
J Van Neel,App stopped working. Automatically closes when i want to watch an episode
Sanele Khumalo,best series app
Pablo ‚ÄúLeboncello‚Äù Hotane,"If there was an option for half or zero rating I would have given that. The entire Showmax product team failed on this one. No research was done, UX is poor and the complete experience sucks. It's the small things that makes the difference e.g. fast forward and rewind is frustrating, old watchlist gone, progress on previous shows gone. Navigating the app I.e. TV/Mobile is the worst in totality. A new shining toy is not always the best. Please fix and better the user experience."
jackson mokatsane,"It keeps saying ""sorry try again"" üò≠üòî I miss the previous version"
Gabriel Munyao,User friendly
KABO MOTHUSI,nonsense app I have to download now and then
Portia Crauser,Since the new version of showmax I've been having trouble viewing a show it says unexpected fatal error it's been a week now that I can't watch showmax what's the point of paying for showmax if it's not gonna work its the second month that I'm having this problem

Mike October,I signed up for the mobile version on my phone; I can't make use of the services for more than two weeks now... getting a fatal playback error warning when trying to enjoy what I've paid for. Not worth having if I can't enjoy the service
REJOICE JOHNSON,"Is it that showmax does not acknowledge people's payment for subscriptions or they have just intensionally decided to waste people's money? I have paid for one month subscription, yet in the app it keeps saying that I have not subscribed. Please you people (showmax) should kindly refund me my money if you are not yet ready for customers. Thank you"

No customer support? Please showmax, either refund me or open the app for me to watch movies. You already debited me. I have been advertising showmax to my friends( unpaid advert). Why are you doing this now with a new app that's not programmed properly?"
chike obinna,worst app previous version is better that it
Xolani Yeka,Nice app

I have to try minimum 3 times before the app starts working and often im promted to reconnect the app to the TV again. I also noticed the basic functions from the old app are not in the new one.

Katlego Mokgatlhe,"This new showmax app is not a good upgrade for most loyal customers/subscribers who have been using showmax for years. Firstly, it doesn't play on TV which have the original app installed, secondly it doesn't support wireless projection from a smart phone to a smart TV, subscribers can no longer enjoy their favorite shows at ease. Showmax made a wrong turn here and you gonna lose subscribers if you don't fix this matter. There nothing interesting about the upgrade. Nothing..."
Ojeli Patrick,Takes time to load. Crashes unnecessarily. Hope it's improved
Samuel kinyanjui,"I understand it does not support screen mirroring but when I play a video through the phone it refuses to play telling me it does not support screen mirroring. What's then the importance of paying it..

Stanley Uwakwe,lovely
Hope Aigbogun (Uzezy Creative Fashion),"I made payment N1200 for the Basic plan through you website on Saturday 9, 2024. They did not give me access to the subscription, they deducted the actual N1200 and still deduct N500 and N350 as decline fee, from my card and bank account, yet I did not get the subscription. I cannot even get access to customer service to explain the issue, all they have is the robot that cannot get solution to my complaints. Please fix this and improve on your service otherwise,"

All in All the previous app I believe was MUCH better."
